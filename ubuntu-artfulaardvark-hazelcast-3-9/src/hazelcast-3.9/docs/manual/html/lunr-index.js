This XML file offers you a declarative way to configure your Hazelcast. It is included in the Hazelcast download package. When you extract the downloaded package, you will see the file `hazelcast.xml` under the `/bin` directory.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;license-key&gt;Your Enterprise License Key&lt;/license-key&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Client Declarative Configuration:**  Native client distributions (Java, C++, .NET) of Hazelcast are open source. However, there are some Hazelcast Enterprise features which can be used with the Java Client such as SSL, Socket Interceptors, High-Density backed Near Cache, etc. In that case, you also need to have a Hazelcast Enterprise license and you should include this license in the file `hazelcast-client-full.xml` which is located under the directory `src/main/resources` of your `hazelcast-client` package. Set the license key in the `hazelcast-client-full.xml` as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast-client&gt;   ...   &lt;license-key&gt;Your Enterprise License Key&lt;/license-key&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Programmatic Configuration:**  Alternatively, you can set your license key programmatically as shown below.  ```java Config config = new Config(); config.setLicenseKey( \&quot;Your Enterprise License Key\&quot; ); ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Spring XML Configuration:**  If you are using Spring with Hazelcast, then you can set the license key using the Spring XML schema, as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hz:config&gt;   ...   &lt;hz:license-key&gt;Your Enterprise License Key&lt;/hz:license-key&gt;   ... &lt;/hz:config&gt; ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **JVM System Property:**  As another option, you can set your license key using the below command (the \&quot;-D\&quot; command line option).  ```plain -Dhazelcast.enterprise.license.key=Your Enterprise License Key ```  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;   "

    body: "### Upgrading from 3.x  - **Upgrading from 3.6.x to 3.7.x when using `JCache`:**  Hazelcast 3.7 introduced changes in `JCache` implementation which broke compatibility of 3.6.x clients to 3.7-3.7.2 cluster members and vice versa,  so 3.7-3.7.2 clients are also incompatible with 3.6.x cluster members. This issue only affects Java clients which use `JCache` functionality.       Starting with Hazelcast 3.7.3, a compatibility option is provided which can be used to ensure backwards compatibility with 3.6.x clients.  In order to upgrade a 3.6.x cluster and clients to 3.7.3 (or later), you will need to use this compatibility option on either the member or the client  side, depending on which one is upgraded first:     * first upgrade your cluster members to 3.7.3, adding property `hazelcast.compatibility.3.6.client=true` to your configuration; when started with this  property, cluster members are compatible with 3.6.x and 3.7.3+ clients but not with 3.7-3.7.2 clients. Once your cluster is upgraded, you may  upgrade your applications to use client version 3.7.3+.     * upgrade your clients from 3.6.x to 3.7.3, adding property `hazelcast.compatibility.3.6.server=true` to your Hazelcast client configuration. A   3.7.3 client started with this compatibility option is compatible with 3.6.x and 3.7.3+ cluster members but incompatible with 3.7-3.7.2 cluster   members. Once your clients are upgraded, you may then proceed to upgrade your cluster members to version 3.7.3 or later.       You may use any of the supported ways [as described in System Properties section](#system-properties) to configure the compatibility option. When done  upgrading your cluster and clients, you may remove the compatibility property from your Hazelcast member configuration.   - **Upgrading from 3.6.x to 3.8.x EE and if you are using  when using `JCache`:**  Due to a compatibility problem CacheConfig serialization may not work if your member is 3.8.x where x &lt; 5. Hence, you will need to use the 3.8.5 or higher version where the problem is being fixed.  - **Introducing the `spring-aware` element:** Before the release 3.5, Hazelcast uses `SpringManagedContext` to scan `SpringAware` annotations by default. This may cause some performance overhead for the users who do not use `SpringAware`. This behavior has been changed with the release of Hazelcast 3.5. `SpringAware` annotations are disabled by default. By introducing the `spring-aware` element, now it is possible to enable it by adding the `&lt;hz:spring-aware /&gt;` tag to the configuration. Please see the [Spring Integration section](#spring-integration).  - **Introducing new configuration options for WAN replication:** Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, WAN replication related system properties, which are configured on a per member basis, can now be configured per target cluster. The 4 system properties below are no longer valid.  	* `hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.batch.size`, please see the [WAN Replication Batch Size](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#batch-size).   	* `hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.batchfrequency.seconds`, please see the [WAN Replication Batch Maximum Delay](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#batch-maximum-delay).  	* `hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.optimeout.millis`, please see the [WAN Replication Response Timeout](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#response-timeout).  	* `hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.queue.capacity`, please see the [WAN Replication Queue Capacity](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#queue-capacity).   - **Removal of deprecated getId() method**:  The method `getId()` in the interface `DistributedObject` has been removed. Please use the method `getName()` instead.  - **Change in the Custom Serialization in the C++ Client Distribution**: Before, the method `getTypeId()` was used to retrieve the ID of the object to be serialized. Now, the method `getHazelcastTypeId()` is used and you give your object as a parameter to this new method. Also, `getTypeId()` was used in your custom serializer class, now it has been renamed to `getHazelcastTypeId()` too. Note that, these changes also apply when you want to switch from Hazelcast 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 too.  - **Important note about Hazelcast System Properties:** Even Hazelcast has not been recommending the usage of `GroupProperties.java` class while benefiting from System Properties, there has been a change to inform to the users who have been using this class. Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, the class `GroupProperties.java` has been replaced by `GroupProperty.java`.  In this new class, system properties are instances of the newly introduced `HazelcastProperty` object. You can access the names of these properties by calling `getName()` method of `HazelcastProperty`.  - **Removal of WanNoDelayReplication**: `WanNoDelayReplication` implementation of Hazelcast's WAN Replication has been removed starting with Hazelcast 3.7. You can still achieve this behavior by setting the batch size to `1` while configuring the WanBatchReplication. Please refer to the [Defining WAN Replication section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.7/manual/html-single/index.html#defining-wan-replication) for more information.  - **Introducing &lt;wan-publisher&gt; element**: Starting with Hazelcast 3.8, the configuration element `&lt;target-cluster&gt;` is replaced with the element `&lt;wan-publisher&gt;` in WAN replication configuration.  - **WaitNotifyService** interface has been renamed as **OperationParker**.  - **Synchronizing WAN Target Cluster**: Starting with Hazelcast 3.8 release, the URL for the REST call has been changed from  `http://member_ip:port/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map` to `http://member_ip:port/hazelcast/rest/mancenter/wan/sync/map`.

    title: "Upgrading from 2.x",
    body: "### Upgrading from 2.x   - **Removal of deprecated static methods:** The static methods of Hazelcast class reaching Hazelcast data components have been removed. The functionality of these methods can be reached from the HazelcastInstance interface. You should replace the following:  ```java Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = Hazelcast.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); ```  with  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); // or if you already started an instance named \&quot;instance1\&quot; // HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName( \&quot;instance1\&quot; ); Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); ```  - **Renaming \&quot;instance\&quot; to \&quot;distributed object\&quot;:** Before 3.0 there was confusion about the term \&quot;instance\&quot;: it was used for both the cluster members and the distributed objects (map, queue, topic, etc. instances). Starting with Hazelcast 3.0, the term instance will be only used for Hazelcast instances, namely cluster members. We will use the term \&quot;distributed object\&quot; for map, queue, etc. instances. You should replace the related methods with the new renamed ones. 3.0 clients are smart clients in that they know in which cluster member the data is located, so you can replace your lite members with native clients.  ```java public static void main( String[] args ) throws InterruptedException {   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;test\&quot; );   Collection&lt;Instance&gt; instances = hazelcastInstance.getInstances();   for ( Instance instance : instances ) {     if ( instance.getInstanceType() == Instance.InstanceType.MAP ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;There is a map with name: \&quot; + instance.getId() );     }   } } ```  with  ```java public static void main( String[] args ) throws InterruptedException {   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   IMap map = hz.getMap( \&quot;test\&quot; );   Collection&lt;DistributedObject&gt; objects = hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects();   for ( DistributedObject distributedObject : objects ) {     if ( distributedObject instanceof IMap ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;There is a map with name: \&quot; + distributedObject.getName() );     }   } } ```  - **Package structure change:** PartitionService has been moved to package `com.hazelcast.core` from `com.hazelcast.partition`.   - **Listener API change:** Before 3.0, `removeListener` methods were taking the Listener object as a parameter. But this caused confusion because same listener object may be used as a parameter for different listener registrations. So we have changed the listener API. `addListener` methods returns a unique ID and you can remove a listener by using this ID. So you should do the following replacement if needed:  ```java IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;map\&quot; ); map.addEntryListener( listener, true ); map.removeEntryListener( listener ); ```      with 	 ```java IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;map\&quot; ); String listenerId = map.addEntryListener( listener, true ); map.removeEntryListener( listenerId ); ```  - **IMap changes:** - `tryRemove(K key, long timeout, TimeUnit timeunit)` returns boolean indicating whether operation is successful. - `tryLockAndGet(K key, long time, TimeUnit timeunit)` is removed. - `putAndUnlock(K key, V value)` is removed. - `lockMap(long time, TimeUnit timeunit)` and `unlockMap()` are removed. - `getMapEntry(K key)` is renamed as `getEntryView(K key)`. The returned object's type, MapEntry class is renamed as EntryView. - There is no predefined names for merge policies. You just give the full class name of the merge policy implementation.  ```xml &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;/merge-policy&gt; ```  Also MergePolicy interface has been renamed to MapMergePolicy and also returning null from the implemented `merge()` method causes the existing entry to be removed.  - **IQueue changes:** There is no change on IQueue API but there are changes on how `IQueue` is configured. With Hazelcast 3.0 there will be no backing map configuration for queue. Settings like backup count will be directly configured on queue config. For queue configuration details, please see the [Queue section](#queue). - **Transaction API change:** In Hazelcast 3.0, transaction API is completely different. Please see the [Transactions chapter](#transactions). - **ExecutorService API change:** Classes MultiTask and DistributedTask have been removed. All the functionality is supported by the newly presented interface IExecutorService. Please see the [Executor Service section](#executor-service). - **LifeCycleService API:** The lifecycle has been simplified. `pause()`, `resume()`, `restart()` methods have been removed. - **AtomicNumber:** `AtomicNumber` class has been renamed to `IAtomicLong`. - **ICountDownLatch:** `await()` operation has been removed. We expect users to use `await()` method with timeout parameters. - **ISemaphore API:** The `ISemaphore` has been substantially changed. `attach()`, `detach()` methods have been removed. - In 2.x releases, the default value for `max-size` eviction policy was **cluster_wide_map_size**. In 3.x releases, default is **PER_NODE**. After upgrading, the `max-size` should be set according to this new default, if it is not changed. Otherwise, it is likely that OutOfMemory exception may be thrown.     "

    title: "Starting the Member and Client",
    body: "## Starting the Member and Client  Having installed Hazelcast, you can get started.   In this short tutorial, you perform the following activities.  1. Create a simple Java application using the Hazelcast distributed map and queue.  2. Run our application twice to have a cluster with two members (JVMs).  3. Connect to our cluster from another Java application by using the Hazelcast Native Java Client API.  Let's begin.   - The following code starts the first Hazelcast member and creates and uses the `customers` map and queue.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.*; import com.hazelcast.config.*;   import java.util.Map; import java.util.Queue;   public class GettingStarted {     public static void main(String[] args) {         Config cfg = new Config();         HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);         Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; mapCustomers = instance.getMap(\&quot;customers\&quot;);         mapCustomers.put(1, \&quot;Joe\&quot;);         mapCustomers.put(2, \&quot;Ali\&quot;);         mapCustomers.put(3, \&quot;Avi\&quot;);           System.out.println(\&quot;Customer with key 1: \&quot;+ mapCustomers.get(1));         System.out.println(\&quot;Map Size:\&quot; + mapCustomers.size());           Queue&lt;String&gt; queueCustomers = instance.getQueue(\&quot;customers\&quot;);         queueCustomers.offer(\&quot;Tom\&quot;);         queueCustomers.offer(\&quot;Mary\&quot;);         queueCustomers.offer(\&quot;Jane\&quot;);         System.out.println(\&quot;First customer: \&quot; + queueCustomers.poll());         System.out.println(\&quot;Second customer: \&quot;+ queueCustomers.peek());         System.out.println(\&quot;Queue size: \&quot; + queueCustomers.size());     } } ```  - Run this `GettingStarted` class a second time to get the second member  started. The members form a cluster and the output is similar to the following.  ``` Members {size:2, ver:1} [     Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - e40081de-056a-4ae5-8ffe-632caf8a6cf1 this     Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 93e82109-16bf-4b16-9c87-f4a6d0873080 ]                               ```  Here, you can see the size of your cluster (`size`) and member list version (`ver`). The member list version will be incremented when changes happen to the cluster, e.g., a member leaving from or joining to the cluster.  The above member list format is introduced with Hazelcast 3.9. You can enable the legacy member list format,  which was used for the releases before Hazelcast 3.9, using the system property `hazelcast.legacy.memberlist.format.enabled`. Please see the [System Properties chapter](#system-properties). The following is an example for the legacy member list format:  ``` Members [2] {     Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - c1ccc8d4-a549-4bff-bf46-9213e14a9fd2 this     Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 33a82dbf-85d6-4780-b9cf-e47d42fb89d4 } ```   - Now, add the `hazelcast-client-`*`&lt;version&gt;`*`.jar` library to your classpath.  This is required to use a Hazelcast client.  - The following code starts a Hazelcast Client, connects to our cluster,  and prints the size of the `customers` map.  ```java package com.hazelcast.test;  import com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig; import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;  public class GettingStartedClient {     public static void main( String[] args ) {         ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();         HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig );         IMap map = client.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );         System.out.println( \&quot;Map Size:\&quot; + map.size() );     } } ``` - When you run it, you see the client properly connecting to the cluster  and printing the map size as **3**.  Hazelcast also offers a tool, **Management Center**, that enables you to monitor your cluster.  To use it, deploy the `mancenter-`*`&lt;version&gt;`*`.war` included in the ZIP file to your web server.  You can use it to monitor your maps, queues, and other distributed data structures and members. Please  see the [Management Center section](#management-center) for usage explanations.   By default, Hazelcast uses Multicast to discover other members that can form a cluster.  If you are  working with other Hazelcast developers on the same network, you may find yourself joining their  clusters under the default settings.  Hazelcast provides a way to segregate clusters within the same  network when using Multicast. Please see the [Creating Cluster Groups](#creating-cluster-groups)  for more information.  Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the default Multicast mechanism,  you can provide a fixed list of IP addresses that are allowed to join. Please see  the [Join Configuration section](#join) for more information. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *You can also check the video tutorials &lt;a href=\&quot;http://hazelcast.org/getting-started/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.* &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;  "

    body: "# Hazelcast Overview   Hazelcast is an open source In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG).  It provides elastically scalable distributed In-Memory computing, widely recognized as the fastest and most scalable approach to application performance. Hazelcast does this in open source. More importantly, Hazelcast makes distributed computing simple by offering distributed implementations of many developer-friendly interfaces from Java such as Map, Queue, ExecutorService, Lock, and JCache. For example, the Map interface provides an In-Memory Key Value store which confers many of the advantages of NoSQL in terms of developer friendliness and developer productivity.  In addition to distributing data In-Memory, Hazelcast provides a convenient set of APIs to access the CPUs in your cluster for maximum processing speed. Hazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since Hazelcast is delivered as a compact library (JAR) and since it has no external dependencies other than Java, it easily plugs into your software solution and provides distributed data structures and distributed computing utilities.  Hazelcast is highly scalable and available (100% operational, never failing). Distributed applications can use Hazelcast for distributed caching, synchronization, clustering, processing, pub/sub messaging, etc. Hazelcast is implemented in Java and has clients for Java, C/C++, .NET and REST. Hazelcast also speaks memcache protocol. It plugs into Hibernate and can easily be used with any existing database system.  If you are looking for In-Memory speed, elastic scalability, and the developer friendliness of NoSQL, Hazelcast is a great choice.  **Hazelcast is Simple**  Hazelcast is written in Java with no other dependencies. It exposes the same API from the familiar Java util package, exposing the same interfaces. Just add `hazelcast.jar` to your classpath and you can quickly enjoy JVMs clustering and start building scalable applications.  **Hazelcast is Peer-to-Peer**  Unlike many NoSQL solutions, Hazelcast is peer-to-peer. There is no master and slave; there is no single point of failure. All members store equal amounts of data and do equal amounts of processing. You can embed Hazelcast in your existing application or use it in client and server mode where your application is a client to Hazelcast members.  **Hazelcast is Scalable**  Hazelcast is designed to scale up to hundreds and thousands of members. Simply add new members and they will automatically discover the cluster and will linearly increase both memory and processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer.  **Hazelcast is Fast**  Hazelcast stores everything in-memory. It is designed to perform very fast reads and updates.  **Hazelcast is Redundant**  Hazelcast keeps the backup of each data entry on multiple members. On a member failure, the data is restored from the backup and the cluster will continue to operate without downtime.  "

If you have an application whose main focal point is asynchronous or high performance computing and lots of task executions, then Embedded deployment is useful. In Embedded deployment, members include both the application and Hazelcast data and services. The advantage of the Embedded deployment is having a low-latency data access.  See the below illustration.  ![Embedded Deployment](images/Embedded.png)    In the Client/Server deployment, Hazelcast data and services are centralized in one or more server members and they are accessed by the application through clients.  You can have a cluster of server members that can be independently created and scaled. Your clients communicate with these members to reach to Hazelcast data and services on them.   See the below illustration.  ![Client/Server Deployment](images/ClientServer.png)  Hazelcast provides native clients (Java, .NET and C++), Memcache and REST clients, Scala, Python and Node.js client implementations.  Client/Server deployment has advantages including more predictable and reliable Hazelcast performance, easier identification of problem causes, and most importantly, better scalability.  When you need to scale in this deployment type, just add more Hazelcast server members. You can address client and server scalability concerns separately.  If you want low-latency data access, as in the Embedded deployment, and you also want the scalability advantages of the Client/Server deployment, you can consider defining Near Caches for your clients. This enables the frequently used data to be kept in the client's local memory. Please refer to [Configuring Client Near Cache](#configuring-client-near-cache).  "

    title: "Why Hazelcast?",
    body: "## Why Hazelcast?    **A Glance at Traditional Data Persistence**  Data is at the core of software systems. In conventional architectures, a relational database persists and provides access to data. Applications are talking directly with a database which has its backup as another machine. To increase performance, tuning or a faster machine is required. This can cost a large amount of money or effort.  There is also the idea of keeping copies of data next to the database, which is performed using technologies like external key-value stores or second level caching that help offload the database. However, when the database is saturated or the applications perform mostly \&quot;put\&quot; operations (writes), this approach is of no use because it insulates the database only from the \&quot;get\&quot; loads (reads). Even if the applications are read-intensive there can be consistency problems--when data changes, what happens to the cache, and how are the changes handled? This is when concepts like time-to-live (TTL) or write-through come in.  In the case of TTL, if the access is less frequent than the TTL, the result will always be a cache miss. On the other hand, in the case of write-through caches, if there are more than one of these caches in a cluster, we again will have consistency issues. This can be avoided by having the nodes communicate with each other so that entry invalidations can be propagated.  We can conclude that an ideal cache would combine TTL and write-through features. There are several cache servers and in-memory database solutions in this field. However, these are stand-alone single instances with a distribution mechanism that is provided by other technologies to an extent. So, we are back to square one; we experience saturation or capacity issues if the product is a single instance or if consistency is not provided by the distribution.  **And, there is Hazelcast**  Hazelcast, a brand new approach to data, is designed around the concept of distribution. Hazelcast shares data around the cluster for flexibility and performance. It is an in-memory data grid for clustering and highly scalable data distribution.  One of the main features of Hazelcast is that it does not have a master member. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created in the cluster) automatically performs the data assignment to cluster members. If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.  Another main feature of Hazelcast is that the data is held entirely in-memory. This is fast. In the case of a failure, such as a member crash, no data will be lost since Hazelcast distributes copies of the data across all the cluster members.  As shown in the feature list in the [Hazelcast Overview](#hazelcast-overview), Hazelcast supports a number of distributed data structures and distributed computing utilities. These provide powerful ways of accessing distributed clustered memory and accessing CPUs for true distributed computing.   **Hazelcast's Distinctive Strengths**   * Hazelcast is open source. * Hazelcast is only a JAR file. You do not need to install software. * Hazelcast is a library, it does not impose an architecture on Hazelcast users. * Hazelcast provides out of the box distributed data structures, such as Map, Queue, MultiMap, Topic, Lock and Executor. * There is no \&quot;master,\&quot; meaning no single point of failure in a Hazelcast cluster; each member in the cluster is configured to be functionally the same. * When the size of your memory and compute requirements increase, new members can be dynamically joined to the Hazelcast cluster to scale elastically. * Data is resilient to member failure. Data backups are distributed across the cluster. This is a big benefit when a member in the cluster crashes as data will not be lost. * Members are always aware of each other unlike in traditional key-value caching solutions. * You can build your own custom-distributed data structures using the Service Programming Interface (SPI) if you are not happy with the data structures provided.  Finally, Hazelcast has a vibrant open source community enabling it to be continuously developed.  Hazelcast is a fit when you need:  -	analytic applications requiring big data processing by partitioning the data. -	to retain frequently accessed data in the grid. -	a cache, particularly an open source JCache provider with elastic distributed scalability. -	a primary data store for applications with utmost performance, scalability and low-latency requirements. -	an In-Memory NoSQL Key Value Store. -	publish/subscribe communication at highest speed and scalability between applications. -	applications that need to scale elastically in distributed and cloud environments. -	a highly available distributed cache for applications. -	an alternative to Coherence and Terracotta.

    body: "## Data Partitioning  As you read in the [Sharding in Hazelcast section](#sharding-in-hazelcast), Hazelcast shards are called Partitions. Partitions are memory segments that can contain hundreds or thousands of data entries each, depending on the memory capacity of your system. Each Hazelcast partition can have multiple replicas, which are distributed among the cluster members. One of the replicas becomes the `primary` and other replicas are called `backups`. Cluster member which owns `primary` replica of a partition is called `partition owner`. When you read or write a particular data entry, you transparently talk to the owner of the partition that contains the data entry.     By default, Hazelcast offers 271 partitions. When you start a cluster with a single member, it owns all of 271 partitions (i.e., it keeps primary replicas for 271 partitions). The following illustration shows the partitions in a Hazelcast cluster with single member.  ![Single Member with Partitions](images/NodePartition.jpg)  When you start a second member on that cluster (creating a Hazelcast cluster with two members), the partition replicas are distributed as shown in the illustration here.  ![Cluster with Two Members - Backups are Created](images/BackupPartitions.jpg)  In the illustration, the partition replicas with black text are primaries and the partition replicas with blue text are backups. The first member has primary replicas of 135 partitions (black), and each of these partitions are backed up in the second member (i.e., the second member owns the backup replicas) (blue). At the same time, the first member also has the backup replicas of the second member's primary partition replicas.  As you add more members, Hazelcast moves some of the primary and backup partition replicas to the new members one by one, making all members equal and redundant. Thanks to the consistent hashing algorithm, only the minimum amount of partitions will be moved to scale out Hazelcast. The following is an illustration of the partition replica distributions in a Hazelcast cluster with four members.  ![Cluster with Four Members](images/4NodeCluster.jpg)  Hazelcast distributes partitions' primary and backup replicas equally among the members of the cluster. Backup replicas of the partitions are maintained for redundancy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Your data can have multiple copies on partition primaries and backups, depending on your backup count. Please see the [Backing Up Maps section](#backing-up-maps).* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  Partition distributions in the above illustrations are for your convenience and descriptive purposes. Normally, the partitions are not distributed in any order (as they are shown in these illustrations), but are distributed randomly. The important point here is that Hazelcast equally distributes the partition primaries and their backup replicas among the members.  Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, lite members are introduced. Lite members are a new type of members that do not own any partition. Lite members are intended for use in computationally-heavy task executions and listener registrations. Although they do not own any partitions, they can access partitions that are owned by other members in the cluster.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please refer to the [Enabling Lite Members section](#enabling-lite-members).* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;    "

The oldest member in the cluster (the one that started first) periodically sends the partition table to all members. In this way each member in the cluster is informed about any changes to partition ownership. The ownerships may be changed when, for example, a new member joins the cluster, or when a member leaves the cluster.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If the oldest member of the cluster goes down, the next oldest member sends the partition table information to the other ones.*  You can configure the frequency (how often) that the member sends the partition table the information by using the `hazelcast.partition.table.send.interval` system property.

Starting with Hazelcast 3.9, it is possible to dynamically add configuration for certain data structures at runtime; these can be added by invoking one of the `Config.add*Config` methods on the `Config` object obtained from a running member's `HazelcastInstance.getConfig()` method. For example:   ``` Config config = new Config(): MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig(\&quot;sessions\&quot;); config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);  HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);  // need to configure another map with no sync backups MapConfig noBackupsMap = new MapConfig(\&quot;dont-backup\&quot;).setBackupCount(0);  // DO NOT DO THIS -- never modify the original Config object // config.addMapConfig(noBackupsMap);  // Instead do this. The added config will be propagated to all members of the cluster instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(noBackupsMap); ```  Dynamic configuration elements must be fully configured before the invocation of `add*Config` method: at that point, the configuration object will be delivered to every member of the cluster and added to each member's dynamic configuration, so mutating the configuration object after the `add*Config` invocation will have no effect.  As dynamically added data structure configuration is propagated across all cluster members, failures may occur due to conditions such as timeout and network partition. The configuration propagation mechanism internally retries adding the configuration whenever a membership change is detected. However if an exception is thrown from `add*Config` method, the configuration may have been partially propagated to some cluster members and adding the configuration should be retried by the user.  Adding new dynamic configuration is supported for all `add*Config` methods except:  - `JobTracker` which has been deprecated since Hazelcast 3.8 - `QuorumConfig`: new quorum configuration cannot be dynamically added but other configuration can reference quorums configured in the existing static configuration - `WanReplicationConfig`: new WAN replication configuration cannot be dynamically added, however existing static ones can be referenced from other configurations, e.g., a new dynamic `MapConfig` may include a `WanReplicationRef` to a statically configured WAN replication config. - `ListenerConfig`: listeners can be instead added at runtime via other API such as `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().addMembershipListener` and `HazelcastInstance.getPartitionService().addMigrationListener`.

The path can be a regular one or a classpath reference with the prefix `classpath:`. -	If the above system property is not set, Hazelcast then checks whether there is a `hazelcast.xml` file in the working directory. -	If not, it then checks whether `hazelcast.xml` exists on the classpath. -	If none of the above works, Hazelcast loads the default configuration (`hazelcast.xml`) that comes with your Hazelcast package.

For example, see the following command that sets two system properties.  ``` -Dgroup.name=dev -Dgroup.password=somepassword ```  Let's get the values of these system properties in the declarative configuration of Hazelcast, as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;group&gt;     &lt;name&gt;${group.name}&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;password&gt;${group.password}&lt;/password&gt;   &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  This also applies to the declarative configuration of Hazelcast Client, as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast-client&gt;   &lt;group&gt;     &lt;name&gt;${group.name}&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;password&gt;${group.password}&lt;/password&gt;   &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ```  If you do not want to rely on the system properties, you can use the `XmlConfigBuilder` and explicitly set a `Properties` instance, as shown below.   ```java Properties properties = new Properties();  // fill the properties, e.g. from database/LDAP, etc.  XmlConfigBuilder builder = new XmlConfigBuilder(); builder.setProperties(properties) Config config = builder.build(); HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); ``` "

    body: "## Discovering Members by TCP  If multicast is not the preferred way of discovery for your environment, then you can configure Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster. When you configure Hazelcast to discover members by TCP/IP, you must list all or a subset of the members' hostnames and/or IP addresses as cluster members. You do not have to list all of these cluster members, but at least one of the listed members has to be active in the cluster when a new member joins.  To set your Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster, set the following configuration elements. Please refer to the [tcp-ip element section](#tcp-ip-element) for the full description of the TCP/IP discovery configuration elements.  - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `multicast` element to \&quot;false\&quot;. - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `aws` element to \&quot;false\&quot;. - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `tcp-ip` element to \&quot;true\&quot;. - Set your `member` elements within the `tcp-ip` element.  The following is an example declarative configuration.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;    ...   &lt;network&gt;     ...     &lt;join&gt;       &lt;multicast enabled=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt;       &lt;/multicast&gt;       &lt;tcp-ip enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;         &lt;member&gt;machine1&lt;/member&gt;         &lt;member&gt;machine2&lt;/member&gt;         &lt;member&gt;machine3:5799&lt;/member&gt;         &lt;member&gt;192.168.1.0-7&lt;/member&gt;         &lt;member&gt;192.168.1.21&lt;/member&gt;       &lt;/tcp-ip&gt;       ...     &lt;/join&gt;     ...   &lt;/network&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  As shown above, you can provide IP addresses or hostnames for `member` elements. You can also give a range of IP addresses, such as `192.168.1.0-7`.  Instead of providing members line-by-line as shown above, you also have the option to use the `members` element and write comma-separated IP addresses, as shown below.  `&lt;members&gt;192.168.1.0-7,192.168.1.21&lt;/members&gt;`  If you do not provide ports for the members, Hazelcast automatically tries the ports 5701, 5702, and so on.  By default, Hazelcast binds to all local network interfaces to accept incoming traffic. You can change this behavior using the system property `hazelcast.socket.bind.any`. If you set this property to `false`, Hazelcast uses the interfaces specified in the `interfaces` element (please refer to the [Interfaces Configuration section](#interfaces)). If no interfaces are provided, then it will try to resolve one interface to bind from the `member` elements.   "

The cluster members do not need to know the concrete addresses of the other members, as they just multicast to all the other members for listening. Whether multicast is possible or allowed depends on your environment.  To set your Hazelcast to multicast auto-discovery, set the following configuration elements. Please refer to the [multicast element section](#multicast-element) for the full description of the multicast discovery configuration elements.  - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `multicast` element to \&quot;true\&quot;. - Set `multicast-group`, `multicast-port`, `multicast-time-to-live`, etc. to your multicast values. - Set the `enabled` attribute of both `tcp-ip` and `aws` elements to \&quot;false\&quot;.  The following is an example declarative configuration.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;    ...   &lt;network&gt;     ...         &lt;join&gt;             &lt;multicast enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;                 &lt;multicast-group&gt;224.2.2.3&lt;/multicast-group&gt;                 &lt;multicast-port&gt;54327&lt;/multicast-port&gt;                 &lt;multicast-time-to-live&gt;32&lt;/multicast-time-to-live&gt;                 &lt;multicast-timeout-seconds&gt;2&lt;/multicast-timeout-seconds&gt;                 &lt;trusted-interfaces&gt;                    &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.102&lt;/interface&gt;                 &lt;/trusted-interfaces&gt;                &lt;/multicast&gt;             &lt;tcp-ip enabled=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt;             &lt;/tcp-ip&gt;             &lt;aws enabled=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt;             &lt;/aws&gt;         &lt;/join&gt;   &lt;network&gt;      ```  Pay attention to the `multicast-timeout-seconds` element. `multicast-timeout-seconds` specifies the time in seconds that a member should wait for a valid multicast response from another member running in the network before declaring itself the leader member (the first member joined to the cluster) and creating its own cluster. This only applies to the startup of members where no leader has been assigned yet. If you specify a high value to `multicast-timeout-seconds`, such as 60 seconds, it means that until a leader is selected, each member will wait 60 seconds before moving on. Be careful when providing a high value. Also, be careful not to set the value too low, or the members might give up too early and create their own cluster.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Multicast auto-discovery is not supported for Hazelcast native clients yet.

A JVM can host multiple Hazelcast instances. Each Hazelcast instance can only participate in one group. Each Hazelcast instance only joins to its own group and does not interact with other groups. The following code example creates three separate Hazelcast instances--`h1` belongs to the `app1` cluster, while `h2` and `h3` belong to the `app2` cluster.  ```java Config configApp1 = new Config(); configApp1.getGroupConfig().setName( \&quot;app1\&quot; ).setPassword( \&quot;app1-pass\&quot; );  Config configApp2 = new Config(); configApp2.getGroupConfig().setName( \&quot;app2\&quot; ).setPassword( \&quot;app2-pass\&quot; );  HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( configApp1 ); HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( configApp2 ); HazelcastInstance h3 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( configApp2 ); ```  ![Note](images/NoteSmall.jpg)***NOTE:*** *Starting with Hazelcast 3.8.2, members with the same group name but with different group passwords (that do not use authentication) forms a cluster.

For this purpose Hazelcast offers a distributed  dynamic class loader.  Using this dynamic class loader, you can control the local caching of the classes loaded from other members,  control the classes to be served to other members, and create blacklists or whitelists of classes and packages. When you enable this feature, you will not have to deploy your classes to all cluster members.  The following is the brief working mechanism of the User Code Deployment feature:  1. Dynamic class loader first checks the local classes, i.e., your classpath, for your custom class. If it is there, Hazelcast does not try to load it from the remote class repository. 2. Then, it checks the cache of classes loaded from the remote class repository (for this, caching should have been enabled in your local, please refer to [Configuring User Code Deployment section](#configuring-used-code-deployment)). If your class is found here, again, Hazelcast does not try to load it from the remote class repository. 3. Finally, dynamic class loader checks the remote class repository. If a member in this repository returns the class, it means your class is found and will be used. You can also put this class into your local class cache as mentioned in the previous step.   "

Its default value is \&quot;true\&quot; and it is a mandatory attribute. - `&lt;class-cache-mode&gt;`: Controls the local caching behavior for the classes loaded from the remote class repository. Available values are as follows:   - `ETERNAL`: Cache the loaded classes locally. This is the default value and suitable when you load long-living objects, such as domain objects stored in a map.   - `OFF`: Do not cache the loaded classes locally. It is suitable for loading runnables, callables, entry processors, etc. - `&lt;provider-mode&gt;`: Controls how the classes are served to the other cluster members. Available values are as follows:   - `LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES`: Serve classes loaded from both local classpath and from other members. This is the default value.   - `LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY`: Serve classes from the local classpath only. Classes loaded from other members will be used locally, but they are not served to other members.   - `OFF`: Never serve classes to other members. - `&lt;blacklist-prefixes&gt;`: Comma separated name prefixes of classes/packages to be prevented from dynamic class loading. For example, if you set it as \&quot;com.foo\&quot;, remote loading of all classes from the \&quot;com.foo\&quot; package will be blacklisted, including the classes from all its sub-packages. If you set it as \&quot;com.foo.Class\&quot;, then the \&quot;Class\&quot; and all classes having the \&quot;Class\&quot; as prefix in the \&quot;com.foo\&quot; package will be blacklisted. There are some built-in prefixes which are blacklisted by default. These are as follows:   - `javax.`   - `java.`   - `sun.`   - `com.hazelcast.` - `&lt;whitelist-prefixes&gt;`: Comma separated name prefixes of classes/packages only from which the classes will be loaded. It allows to quickly configure remote loading only for classes from selected packages. It can be used together with blacklisting. For example, you can whitelist the prefix \&quot;com.foo\&quot; and blacklist the prefix \&quot;com.foo.secret\&quot;. - `&lt;provider-filter&gt;`: Filter to constraint members to be used for a class loading request when a class is not available locally. The value is in the format \&quot;HAS_ATTRIBUTE:foo\&quot;. When it is set as \&quot;HAS_ATTRIBUTE:foo\&quot;, the class loading request will only be sent to the members which have \&quot;foo\&quot; as a [member attribute](#defining-member-attributes). Setting this to null will allow to load classes from all members. Please see an example in the below section.  "

    title: "Partition Group Configuration",
    body: "## Partition Group Configuration  Hazelcast distributes key objects into partitions using the consistent hashing algorithm. Multiple replicas are created for each partition and those partition replicas are distributed among Hazelcast members. An entry is stored in the members that own replicas of the partition to which the entry's key is assigned. The total partition count is 271 by default; you can change it with the configuration property `hazelcast.partition.count`. Please see the [System Properties section](#system-properties).  Hazelcast member that owns the primary replica of a partition is called as partition owner. Other replicas are called backups. Based on the configuration, a key object can be kept in multiple replicas of a partition. A member can hold at most one replica of a partition (ownership or backup).   By default, Hazelcast distributes partition replicas randomly and equally among the cluster members, assuming all members in the cluster are identical. But what if some members share the same JVM or physical machine or chassis and you want backups of these members to be assigned to members in another machine or chassis? What if processing or memory capacities of some members are different and you do not want an equal number of partitions to be assigned to all members?  To deal with such scenarios, you can group members in the same JVM (or physical machine) or members located in the same chassis. Or you can group members to create identical capacity. We call these groups **partition groups**. Partitions are assigned to those partition groups instead of individual members. Backup replicas of a partition which is owned by a partition group are located in other partition groups.  "

index.add({
    url: "partitiongroupconfig.html#grouping-types",
    title: "Grouping Types",
    body: "### Grouping Types  When you enable partition grouping, Hazelcast presents the following choices for you to configure partition groups.  **1. HOST_AWARE:**   You can group members automatically using the IP addresses of members, so members sharing the same network interface will be grouped together. All members on the same host (IP address or domain name) will be a single partition group. This helps to avoid data loss when a physical server crashes, because multiple replicas of the same partition are not stored on the same host. But if there are multiple network interfaces or domain names per physical machine, that will make this assumption invalid.  Following are declarative and programmatic configuration snippets that show how to enable HOST_AWARE grouping.  ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;HOST_AWARE\&quot; /&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.HOST_AWARE ); ```  **2. CUSTOM:**  You can do custom grouping using Hazelcast's interface matching configuration. This way, you can add different and multiple interfaces to a group. You can also use wildcards in the interface addresses. For example, the users can create rack-aware or data warehouse partition groups using custom partition grouping.  Following are declarative and programmatic configuration examples that show how to enable and use CUSTOM grouping.  ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;CUSTOM\&quot;&gt; &lt;member-group&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.0.*&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.3.*&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.5.*&lt;/interface&gt; &lt;/member-group&gt; &lt;member-group&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.10.10-100&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.1.*&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.2.*&lt;/interface&gt; &lt;/member-group &lt;/partition-group&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.CUSTOM );  MemberGroupConfig memberGroupConfig = new MemberGroupConfig(); memberGroupConfig.addInterface( \&quot;10.10.0.*\&quot; ) .addInterface( \&quot;10.10.3.*\&quot; ).addInterface(\&quot;10.10.5.*\&quot; );  MemberGroupConfig memberGroupConfig2 = new MemberGroupConfig(); memberGroupConfig2.addInterface( \&quot;10.10.10.10-100\&quot; ) .addInterface( \&quot;10.10.1.*\&quot;).addInterface( \&quot;10.10.2.*\&quot; );  partitionGroupConfig.addMemberGroupConfig( memberGroupConfig ); partitionGroupConfig.addMemberGroupConfig( memberGroupConfig2 ); ```  **3. PER_MEMBER:**  You can give every member its own group. Each member is a group of its own and primary and backup partitions are distributed randomly (not on the same physical member). This gives the least amount of protection and is the default configuration for a Hazelcast cluster. This grouping type provides good redundancy when Hazelcast members are on separate hosts. However, if multiple instances run on the same host, this type is not a good option.   Following are declarative and programmatic configuration snippets that show how to enable PER_MEMBER grouping.   ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;PER_MEMBER\&quot; /&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.PER_MEMBER ); ```  **4. ZONE_AWARE:**  You can use ZONE_AWARE configuration with [Hazelcast AWS](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws), [Hazelcast jclouds](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jclouds) or [Hazelcast Azure](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure) Discovery Service plugins.   As discovery services, these plugins put zone, rack, and host information to the Hazelcast [member attributes](#defining-member-attributes) map during the discovery process. Hazelcast creates the partition groups with respect to member attributes map entries that include zone, rack, and host information, which are the ZONE_AWARE configuration properties.  You can also configure these properties manually using Hazelcast's member attributes, and the following are the related property names:  - `hazelcast.partition.group.zone`: For the zones in the same area. - `hazelcast.partition.group.rack`: For different racks in the same zone. - `hazelcast.partition.group.host`: For a shared physical member if virtualization is used.  Here is how to put them in a declarative configuration:  ``` &lt;member-attributes&gt;   &lt;attribute name=\&quot;hazelcast.partition.group.zone\&quot;&gt;zone name&lt;/attribute&gt;   &lt;attribute name=\&quot;hazelcast.partition.group.rack\&quot;&gt;rack name&lt;/attribute&gt;   &lt;attribute name=\&quot;hazelcast.partition.group.host\&quot;&gt;host name&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/member-attributes&gt; ```   When using ZONE_AWARE configuration, backups are created in the other zones. Each zone will be accepted as one partition group.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Some cloud providers have rack information instead of zone information. In such cases, Hazelcast looks for zone, rack, and host information in the given order.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  Following are declarative and programmatic configuration snippets that show how to enable ZONE_AWARE grouping.  ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;ZONE_AWARE\&quot; /&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.ZONE_AWARE ); ```  **5. SPI:**  You can provide your own partition group implementation using the SPI configuration. To create your partition group implementation, you need to first extend the `DiscoveryStrategy` class of the discovery service plugin, override the method `public PartitionGroupStrategy getPartitionGroupStrategy()`, and return the `PartitionGroupStrategy` configuration in that overridden method.   Following is a sample code covering the implementation steps mentioned in the above paragraph:   ``` public class CustomDiscovery extends JCloudsDiscoveryStrategy {      public CustomDiscovery(Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; properties) {         super(properties);     }          @Override     public PartitionGroupStrategy getPartitionGroupStrategy() {         return new CustomPartitionGroupStrategy();     }      private class CustomPartitionGroupStrategy implements PartitionGroupStrategy {         @Override         public Iterable&lt;MemberGroup&gt; getMemberGroups() {             ...             ...         }     } }  ``` "

To use it, implement the `com.hazelcast.logging.LoggerFactory` and `com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger` interfaces and set the system property `hazelcast.logging.class` as your custom `LoggerFactory` class name.  ```plain -Dhazelcast.logging.class=foo.bar.MyLoggingFactory ```  You can also listen to logging events generated by Hazelcast runtime by registering `LogListener`s to `LoggingService`.  ```java LogListener listener = new LogListener() {   public void log( LogEvent logEvent ) {     // do something   } } HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); LoggingService loggingService = instance.getLoggingService(); loggingService.addLogListener( Level.INFO, listener ); ``` Through the `LoggingService`, you can get the currently used ILogger implementation and log your own messages too.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If you are not using command line for configuring logging, you should be careful about Hazelcast classes. They may be defaulted to `jdk` logging before newly configured logging is read. When logging mechanism is selected, it will not change.*  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; "

Meaning that, if you set the value of port as 5701, as members are joining to the cluster, Hazelcast tries to find ports between 5701 and 5801. You can choose to change the port count in the cases like having large instances on a single machine or willing to have only a few ports to be assigned. The parameter `port-count` is used for this purpose, whose default value is 100.    - `auto-increment`: According to the above example, Hazelcast will try to find free ports between 5701 and 5801. Normally, you will not need to change this value, but it will come very handy when needed. You may also want to choose to use only one port. In that case, you can disable the auto-increment feature of `port` by setting `auto-increment` to `false`.   The parameter `port-count` is ignored when the above configuration is made.  "

    body: "### Member Address Provider SPI  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *This SPI is not intended to provide addresses of other cluster members with which the Hazelcast instance will form a cluster. To do that, refer to the other network configuration sections above.*  By default, Hazelcast chooses the public and bind address. You can influence on the choice by defining a `public-address` in the configuration or by using other properties mentioned above. In some cases, though, these properties are not enough and the default address picking strategy will choose wrong addresses. This may be the case when deploying Hazelcast in some cloud environments, such as AWS, when using Docker or when the instance is deployed behind a NAT and the `public-address` property is not enough (please see the [Public Address section](#public-address)).  In these cases, it is possible to configure the bind and public address in a more advanced way. You can provide an implementation of the `com.hazelcast.spi.MemberAddressProvider` interface which will provide the bind and public address. The implementation may then choose these addresses in any way - it may read from a system property or file or even invoke a web service to retrieve the public and private address.   The details of the implementation depend heavily on the environment in which Hazelcast is deployed. As such, we will demonstrate how to configure Hazelcast to use a simplified custom member address provider SPI implementation. An example of an implementation is shown below:  ```java public static final class SimpleMemberAddressProvider implements MemberAddressProvider {     @Override     public InetSocketAddress getBindAddress() {         // determine the address using some configuration, calling an API, ...         return new InetSocketAddress(hostname, port);     }      @Override     public InetSocketAddress getPublicAddress() {         // determine the address using some configuration, calling an API, ...         return new InetSocketAddress(hostname, port);     } } ```  Note that if the bind address port is `0` then it will use a port as configured in the Hazelcast network configuration (see the [Port section](#port)). If the public address port is set to `0` then it will broadcast the same port that it is bound to. If you wish to bind to any local interface, you may return `new InetSocketAddress((InetAddress) null, port)` from the `getBindAddress()` address.  The following configuration examples contain properties that will be provided to the constructor of the provided class. If you do not provide any properties, the class may have either a no-arg constructor or a constructor accepting a single `java.util.Properties` instance. On the other hand, if you do provide properties in the configuration, the class must have a constructor accepting a single `java.util.Properties` instance.   **Declarative:**  ```xml    &lt;network&gt;         &lt;member-address-provider enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;             &lt;class-name&gt;SimpleMemberAddressProvider&lt;/class-name&gt;             &lt;properties&gt;                 &lt;property name=\&quot;prop1\&quot;&gt;prop1-value&lt;/property&gt;                 &lt;property name=\&quot;prop2\&quot;&gt;prop2-value&lt;/property&gt;             &lt;/properties&gt;         &lt;/member-address-provider&gt;         &lt;!-- other network configuration --&gt;    &lt;network&gt; ```  **Programmatic:**  ```java Config config = new Config(); MemberAddressProviderConfig memberAddressProviderConfig = config.getNetworkConfig().getMemberAddressProviderConfig(); memberAddressProviderConfig       .setEnabled(true)       .setClassName(MemberAddressProviderWithStaticProperties.class.getName()); Properties properties = memberAddressProviderConfig.getProperties(); properties.setProperty(\&quot;prop1\&quot;, \&quot;prop1-value\&quot;); properties.setProperty(\&quot;prop2\&quot;, \&quot;prop2-value\&quot;);  config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false);  // perform other configuration  Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); ```"

A workaround to this limitation is to use unreliable failure detectors. An unreliable failure detector allows a member to suspect that others have failed, usually based on liveness criteria but it can make mistakes to a certain degree.

The value of phi will increase when the period since the last heartbeat gets longer. If the network becomes slow or unreliable, the resulting mean and variance will increase, there will need to be a longer period for which no heartbeat is received before the member is suspected.   `hazelcast.heartbeat.interval.seconds` and `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds` properties will still be used as period of heartbeat messages and deadline of heartbeat messages. Since _Phi Accrual Failure Detector_ is adaptive to network conditions, a much lower `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds` can be defined than _Deadline Failure Detector_'s timeout.  Additional to above two properties, _Phi Accrual Failure Detector_ has three more configuration properties:  - `hazelcast.heartbeat.phiaccrual.failuredetector.threshold`: This is the phi threshold for suspicion. After calculated phi exceeds this threshold, a member is considered as unreachable and marked as suspected. A low threshold allows to detect member crashes/failures faster but can generate more mistakes and cause wrong member suspicions. A high threshold generates fewer mistakes but is slower to detect actual crashes/failures.   `phi = 1` means likeliness that we will make a mistake is about `10%`. The likeliness is about `1%` with `phi = 2`, `0.1%` with `phi = 3`, and so on. Default phi threshold is 10.  - `hazelcast.heartbeat.phiaccrual.failuredetector.sample.size`: Number of samples to keep for history. Default value is 200.  - `hazelcast.heartbeat.phiaccrual.failuredetector.min.std.dev.millis`: Minimum standard deviation to use for the normal distribution used when calculating phi. Too low standard deviation might result in too much sensitivity.

The rolling upgrade process for this cluster, i.e., replacing existing `3.8.0` members one by one with an upgraded one at version `3.9.0`, includes the following steps which should be repeated for each member:   * Shutdown gracefully an existing `3.8.0` member.  * Wait until all partition migrations are completed; during migrations, membership changes (member joins or removals) are not allowed.  * Update the member with the new `3.9.0` Hazelcast binaries.  * Start the member and wait until it joins the cluster. You should see something like the following in your logs:  ```  ...  INFO: [192.168.2.2]:5701 [cluster] [3.9] Hazelcast 3.9 (20170630 - a67dc3a) starting at [192.168.2.2]:5701  ...  INFO: [192.168.2.2]:5701 [cluster] [3.9] Cluster version set to 3.8 ```    The version in brackets `[3.9]` still denotes the member's codebase version (running on the hypothetical `hazelcast-3.9.jar` binary). Once the member  locates existing cluster members, it sends its join request to the master. The master validates that the new member is allowed to join the cluster and  lets the new member know that the cluster is currently operating at `3.8` cluster version. The new member sets `3.8` as its cluster version and starts operating  normally.    At this point all members of the cluster have been upgraded to codebase version `3.9.0` but the cluster still operates at cluster version `3.8`. In order to use `3.9` features  the cluster version must be changed to `3.9`. There are two ways to accomplish this:     * Use [Management Center](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/Rolling_Upgrade.html).  * Use the command line [cluster.sh script](#using-the-script-cluster-sh).   ***NOTE:*** *You need to upgrade your Management Center version *before* upgrading the member version if you want to  change cluster version using Management Center. Management Center is compatible with the previous minor version of  Hazelcast, starting with version 3.9. For example, Management Center 3.9 works with both Hazelcast IMDG  3.8 and 3.9. To change your cluster version to 3.9, you need Management Center 3.9.*   "

This is a requirement to ensure that all members participating in each one of the subclusters will be able to operate as members of the merged cluster at the same cluster version.

In order for the two subclusters to merge, it is necessary to change the cluster version of the subcluster that still operates at the old cluster version, so that both subclusters will be operating at the same, upgraded cluster version and will be able to merge as soon as the network partition is fixed.

In order for the cluster version to be set, one of the following must happen:   * the member cannot locate any members of the cluster to join or is configured without a joiner: in this case, the member will appoint itself as the  master of a new single-member cluster and its cluster version will be set to the `major.minor` version of its own codebase version. So a standalone  member running on codebase version `3.8.0` will set its own cluster version to `3.8`.  * the member that is starting locates members of the cluster and identifies which is the master: in this case, the master will validate that the  joining member's codebase version is compatible with the current cluster version. If it is found to be compatible, then the member joins and the master  sends the cluster version, which is set on the joining member. Otherwise, the starting member fails to join and shuts down.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **What if a new Hazelcast minor version changes fundamental cluster protocol communication, like join messages?**  ***NOTE:*** *The version numbers used in the paragraph below are only used as an example.*  On startup, as [explained above](#how-is-the-cluster-version-set), the cluster version is not yet known to a member that has not joined any cluster. By default the newly started member will use the cluster protocol that corresponds to its codebase version until this member joins a cluster (so for codebase `3.9.0` this means implicitly assuming cluster version `3.9`). If, hypothetically, major changes in discovery &amp; join operations have been introduced which do not allow the member to join a `3.8` cluster, then the member should be explicitly configured to start assuming a `3.8` cluster version.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Do I have to upgrade clients to work with rolling upgrades?**  Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, the Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol was introduced. Clients which implement the Open Binary Client Protocol are compatible with Hazelcast version 3.6 and newer minor versions. Thus older client versions will be compatible with next minor versions. Newer clients connected to a cluster will operate at the lower version of capabilities until all members are upgraded and the cluster version upgrade occurs.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Can I stop and start multiple members at once during a rolling member upgrade?**  It is not recommended due to potential network partitions. It is advised to always stop and start one member in each upgrade step.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Can I upgrade my business app together with Hazelcast while doing a rolling member upgrade?**  Yes, but make sure to make the new version of your app compatible with the old one since there will be a timespan when both versions interoperate. Checking if two versions of your app are compatible includes verifying binary and algorithmic compatibility, and some other steps.  It is worth mentioning that a business app upgrade is orthogonal to a rolling member upgrade. A rolling business app upgrade may be done without upgrading the members.  "

    body: "# Distributed Data Structures  As mentioned in the [Overview section](#hazelcast-overview), Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of Java interfaces. Below is the list of these implementations with links to the corresponding sections in this manual.  - **Standard utility collections**  	- [Map](#map) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.Map`. It lets you read from and write to a Hazelcast map with methods such as `get` and `put`. 	- [Queue](#queue) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`. You can add an item in one member and remove it from another one. 	- [Ringbuffer](#ringbuffer) is implemented for reliable eventing system. It is also a distributed data structure. 	- [Set](#set) is the distributed and concurrent implementation of `java.util.Set`. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not preserve their order. 	- [List](#list) is similar to Hazelcast Set. The only difference is that it allows duplicate elements and preserves their order. 	- [MultiMap](#multimap) is a specialized Hazelcast map. It is a distributed data structure where you can store multiple values for a single key. 	- [Replicated Map](#replicated-map) does not partition data. It does not spread data to different cluster members. Instead, it replicates the data to all members. 	- [Cardinality Estimator](#cardinality-estimator-service) is a data structure which implements Flajolet's HyperLogLog algorithm.  - **Topic** is the distributed mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. It is also known as the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Please see the [Topic section](#topic) for more information. Hazelcast also has a structure called Reliable Topic which uses the same interface of Hazelcast Topic. The difference is that it is backed up by the Ringbuffer data structure. Please see the [Reliable Topic section](#reliable-topic).  - **Concurrency utilities**  	- [Lock](#lock) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`. When you use lock, the critical section that Hazelcast Lock guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. 	- [Semaphore](#isemaphore) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`. When performing concurrent activities, semaphores offer permits to control the thread counts. 	- [AtomicLong](#iatomiclong) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong`. Most of AtomicLong's operations are available. However, these operations involve remote calls and hence their performances differ from AtomicLong, due to being distributed. 	- [AtomicReference](#iatomicreference) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`. When you need to deal with a reference in a distributed environment, you can use Hazelcast AtomicReference.  	- [IdGenerator](#idgenerator) is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. ID generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()`. 	- [CountdownLatch](#icountdownlatch) is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`. Hazelcast CountDownLatch is a gate keeper for concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations.     "

    title: "Loading and Destroying a Distributed Object",
    body: "#### Loading and Destroying a Distributed Object  Hazelcast offers a `get` method for most of its distributed objects. To load an object, first create a Hazelcast instance and then use the related `get` method on this instance. Following example code snippet creates an Hazelcast instance and a map on this instance.  ```java public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); ```  As to the configuration of distributed object, Hazelcast uses the default settings from the file `hazelcast.xml` that comes with your Hazelcast download. Of course, you can provide an explicit configuration in this XML or programmatically according to your needs. Please see the [Understanding Configuration section](#understanding-configuration).  Note that, most of Hazelcast's distributed objects are created lazily, i.e., a distributed object is created once the first operation accesses it.  If you want to use an object you loaded in other places, you can safely reload it using its reference without creating a new Hazelcast instance (`customers` in the above example).  To destroy a Hazelcast distributed object, you can use the method `destroy`. This method clears and releases all resources of the object. Therefore, you must use it with care since a reload with the same object reference after the object is destroyed creates a new data structure without an error. Please see the following example code where one of the queues are destroyed and the other one is accessed.  ```java public class Member {    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {       HazelcastInstance hz1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();       HazelcastInstance hz2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();       IQueue&lt;String&gt; q1 = hz1.getQueue(\&quot;q\&quot;);       IQueue&lt;String&gt; q2 = hz2.getQueue(\&quot;q\&quot;);       q1.add(\&quot;foo\&quot;);       System.out.println(\&quot;q1.size: \&quot;+q1.size()+ \&quot; q2.size:\&quot;+q2.size());       q1.destroy();       System.out.println(\&quot;q1.size: \&quot;+q1.size() + \&quot; q2.size:\&quot;+q2.size());     } } ```  If you start the `Member` above, the output will be as shown below:  ``` q1.size: 1 q2.size:1 q1.size: 0 q2.size:0 ```  As you see, no error is generated and a new queue resource is created.

If you want to put these two into the same partition, you use the `@` symbol as shown below:  ```java public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); 	ISemaphore s1 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(\&quot;s1@foo\&quot;); 	ISemaphore s2 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(\&quot;s2@foo\&quot;); ```  Now, these two semaphores will be put into the same partition whose partition key is `foo`. Note that you can use the method `getPartitionKey` to learn the partition key of a distributed object. It may be useful when you want to create an object in the same partition of an existing object.

Each member carries approximately \&quot;(1/n `*` total-data) + backups\&quot;, **n** being the number of members in the cluster. For example, if you have a member with 1000 objects to be stored in the cluster, and then you start a second member, each member will both store 500 objects and back up the 500 objects in the other member.  Let's create a Hazelcast instance and fill a map named `Capitals` with key-value pairs using the following code. Use the HazelcastInstance `getMap` method to get the map, then use the map `put` method to put an entry into the map.  ```java public class FillMapMember {   public static void main( String[] args ) {      HazelcastInstance hzInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     Map&lt;String, String&gt; capitalcities = hzInstance.getMap( \&quot;capitals\&quot; );      capitalcities.put( \&quot;1\&quot;, \&quot;Tokyo\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;2\&quot;, \&quot;Paris” );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;3\&quot;, \&quot;Washington\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;4\&quot;, \&quot;Ankara\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;5\&quot;, \&quot;Brussels\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;6\&quot;, \&quot;Amsterdam\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;7\&quot;, \&quot;New Delhi\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;8\&quot;, \&quot;London\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;9\&quot;, \&quot;Berlin\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;10\&quot;, \&quot;Oslo\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;11\&quot;, \&quot;Moscow\&quot; );     ...     ...     capitalcities.put( \&quot;120\&quot;, \&quot;Stockholm\&quot; );   } } ```  When you run this code, a cluster member is created with a map whose entries are distributed across the members' partitions. See the below illustration. For now, this is a single member cluster.  ![Map Entries in a Single Member](images/1Node.png)  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Please note that some of the partitions will not contain any data entries since we only have 120 objects and the partition count is 271 by default.

The following illustration shows two members and how the data and its backup is distributed.  ![Map Entries with Backups in Two Members](images/2Nodes.png)  As you see, when a new member joins the cluster, it takes ownership and loads some of the data in the cluster. Eventually, it will carry almost \&quot;(1/n `*` total-data) + backups\&quot; of the data, reducing the load on other members.  `HazelcastInstance::getMap` returns an instance of `com.hazelcast.core.IMap` which extends  the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` interface. Methods like  `ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(key,value)` and `ConcurrentMap.replace(key,value)` can be used  on the distributed map, as shown in the example below.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;  HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();  Customer getCustomer( String id ) {     ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     Customer customer = customers.get( id );     if (customer == null) {         customer = new Customer( id );         customer = customers.putIfAbsent( id, customer );     }     return customer; }                 public boolean updateCustomer( Customer customer ) {     ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     return ( customers.replace( customer.getId(), customer ) != null );             }                  public boolean removeCustomer( Customer customer ) {     ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     return customers.remove( customer.getId(), customer );            } ```  All `ConcurrentMap` operations such as `put` and `remove` might wait if the key is locked by another thread in the local or remote JVM. But, they will eventually return with success. `ConcurrentMap` operations never throw a `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`.

To create synchronous backups, select the number of backup copies using the `backup-count` property.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;map name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;     &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;/backup-count&gt;   &lt;/map&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  When this count is 1, a map entry will have its backup on one other member in the cluster. If you set it to 2, then a map entry will have its backup on two other members. You can set it to 0 if you do not want your entries to be backed up, e.g., if performance is more important than backing up. The maximum value for the backup count is 6.  Hazelcast supports both synchronous and asynchronous backups. By default, backup operations are synchronous and configured with `backup-count`. In this case, backup operations block operations until backups are successfully copied to backup members (or deleted from backup members in case of remove) and acknowledgements are received.

By default, `map.get(key)` will always read the value from the actual owner of the key for consistency.  To enable backup reads (read local backup entries), set the value of the `read-backup-data` property to **true**. Its default value is **false** for consistency. Enabling backup reads can improve performance but on the other hand it can cause stale reads while still preserving monotonic-reads property.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;map name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;     &lt;backup-count&gt;0&lt;/backup-count&gt;     &lt;async-backup-count&gt;1&lt;/async-backup-count&gt;     &lt;read-backup-data&gt;true&lt;/read-backup-data&gt;   &lt;/map&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  This feature is available when there is at least one sync or async backup.

    body: "#### Understanding Map Eviction  Hazelcast Map performs eviction based on partitions. For example, when you specify a size using the `PER_NODE` attribute for `max-size` (please see [Configuring Map Eviction](#configuring-map-eviction)), Hazelcast internally calculates the maximum size for every partition. Hazelcast uses the following equation to calculate the maximum size of a partition:  ``` partition maximum size = max-size * member-count / partition-count ```  The eviction process starts according to this calculated partition maximum size when you try to put an entry. When entry count in that partition exceeds partition maximum size, eviction starts on that partition.  Assume that you have the following figures as examples:  * Partition count: 200 * Entry count for each partition: 100 * `max-size` (PER_NODE): 20000  The total number of entries here is 20000 (partition count * entry count for each partition). This means you are at the eviction threshold since you set the `max-size` to 20000. When you try to put an entry  1. the entry goes to the relevant partition; 2. the partition checks whether the eviction threshold is reached (`max-size`); 3. only one entry will be evicted.  As a result of this eviction process, when you check the size of your map, it is 19999. After this eviction, subsequent put operations will not trigger the next eviction until the map size is again close to the `max-size`.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The above scenario is simply an example that describes how the eviction process works. Hazelcast finds the most optimum number of entries to be evicted according to your cluster size and selected policy.*   "

If it is not 0, entries that are older than this time and not updated for this time are evicted automatically. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Default value is 0, which means infinite. If it is not 0, entries are evicted regardless of the set `eviction-policy`. - `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in the map. Entries that are idle for more than this time are evicted automatically. An entry is idle if no `get`, `put`, `EntryProcessor.process` or `containsKey` is called. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Default value is 0, which means infinite. - `eviction-policy`: Valid values are described below. 	- NONE: Default policy. If set, no items will be evicted and the property `max-size` will be ignored. You still can combine it with `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds`. 	- LRU: Least Recently Used. 	- LFU: Least Frequently Used.  - `max-size`: Maximum size of the map. When maximum size is reached, the map is evicted based on the policy defined. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Default value is 0. If you want `max-size` to work, set the `eviction-policy` property to a value other than NONE. Its attributes are described below. 	- `PER_NODE`: Maximum number of map entries in each cluster member. This is the default policy. If you use this option, please note that you cannot set the `max-size` to a value lower than the partition count (which is 271 by default).		  		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;PER_NODE\&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/max-size&gt;`  	- `PER_PARTITION`: Maximum number of map entries within each partition. Storage size depends on the partition count in a cluster member. This attribute should not be used often. For instance, avoid using this attribute with a small cluster.

It retries this five times. * If the result of above step is still not enough, forced eviction applies the above step to all maps. This time it might perform eviction from some other partitions too,provided that they are owned by the same thread. * If that is still not enough to free up your memory, it evicts not the 20% but all the entries from the current partition. * if that is not enough, it will evict all the entries from the other data structures; from the partitions owned by the local thread.

    body: "### Setting In-Memory Format  IMap (and a few other Hazelcast data structures, such as ICache) has an `in-memory-format` configuration option. By default, Hazelcast stores data into memory in binary (serialized) format. Sometimes it can be efficient to store the entries in their object form, especially in cases of local processing, such as entry processor and queries.  To set how the data will be stored in memory, set `in-memory-format` in the configuration. You have the following format options:  - `BINARY` (default). The data (both the key and value) will be stored in serialized binary format. You can use this option if you mostly perform regular map operations, such as `put` and `get`.  - `OBJECT`. The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is good for maps where entry processing and queries form the majority of all operations and the objects are complex, making the serialization cost comparatively high. By storing objects, entry processing will not contain the deserialization cost. Note that when you use `OBJECT` as the in-memory format, the key will still be stored in binary format, and the value will be stored in object format.   - `NATIVE`: (&lt;font color=\&quot;##153F75\&quot;&gt;**Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD**&lt;/font&gt;) This format behaves the same as BINARY, however, instead of heap memory, key and value will be stored in the off-heap memory.  Regular operations like `get` rely on the object instance. When the `OBJECT` format is used and a `get` is performed, the map does not return the stored instance, but creates a clone. Therefore, this whole `get` operation first includes a serialization on the member owning the instance, and then a deserialization on the member calling the instance. When the `BINARY` format is used, only a deserialization is required; `BINARY` is faster.  Similarly, a `put` operation is faster when the `BINARY` format is used. If the format was `OBJECT`, the map would create a clone of the instance, and there would first be a serialization and then a deserialization. When BINARY is used, only a deserialization is needed.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If a value is stored in `OBJECT` format, a change on a returned value does not affect the stored instance. In this case, the returned instance is not the actual one but a clone. Therefore, changes made on an object after it is returned will not reflect on the actual stored data. Similarly, when a value is written to a map and the value is stored in `OBJECT` format, it will be a copy of the `put` value. Therefore, changes made on the object after it is stored will not reflect on the stored data.* "

In case of `BINARY` and `OBJECT` in-memory formats, Hazelcast stores your distributed data into the heap of its server instances. Java heap is subject to garbage collection (GC). In case of larger heaps, garbage collection might cause your application to pause for tens of seconds (even minutes for really large heaps), badly affecting your application performance and response times.  As the data gets bigger, you either run the application with larger heap, which would result in longer GC pauses or run multiple instances with smaller heap which can turn into an operational nightmare if the number of such instances becomes very high.  To overcome this challenge, Hazelcast offers High-Density Memory Store for your maps. You can configure your map to use High-Density Memory Store by setting the in-memory format to `NATIVE`. The following snippet is the declarative configuration example.   ```xml &lt;map name=\&quot;nativeMap*\&quot;&gt;    &lt;in-memory-format&gt;NATIVE&lt;/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;/map&gt; ```  Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store usage for your cluster.

If `MapStore` throws an exception then the exception is propagated to the original `put` or `remove` call in the form of `RuntimeException`.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *There is a key difference in the behaviors of `map.remove(key)` and `map.delete(key)`, i.e., the latter results in `MapStore.delete(key)` to be invoked whereas the former only removes the entry from IMap.*  "

    body: "#### Setting Write-Behind Persistence  You can configure `MapStore` as write-behind by setting the `write-delay-seconds` property to a value bigger than **0**. This means the modified entries will be put to the data store asynchronously after a configured delay.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by default, which means it applies only the last update on that key. However, you can set `MapStoreConfig#setWriteCoalescing` to `FALSE` and you can store all updates performed on a key to the data store.*  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *When you set `MapStoreConfig#setWriteCoalescing` to `FALSE`, after you reached per-node maximum write-behind-queue capacity, subsequent put operations will fail with `ReachedMaxSizeException`. This exception will be thrown to prevent uncontrolled grow of write-behind queues. You can set per-node maximum capacity using the system property `hazelcast.map.write.behind.queue.capacity`. Please refer to the [System Properties section](#system-properties) for information on this property and how to set the system properties.*   In write-behind mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:  - In-Memory entry is updated. - In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other cluster members (if `backup-count` is greater than 0). - The entry is marked as dirty so that after `write-delay-seconds`, it can be persisted with `MapStore.store(key,value)` call. - For fault tolerance, dirty entries are stored in a queue on the primary member and also on a back-up member.  The same behavior goes for the `map.remove(key)`, the only difference is that  `MapStore.delete(key)` is called when the entry will be deleted.  If `MapStore` throws an exception, then Hazelcast tries to store the entry again. If the entry still cannot be stored, a log message is printed and the entry is re-queued.   For batch write operations, which are only allowed in write-behind mode, Hazelcast will call `MapStore.storeAll(map)` and `MapStore.deleteAll(collection)` to do all writes in a single call. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If a map entry is marked as dirty, meaning that it is waiting to be persisted to the `MapStore` in a write-behind scenario, the eviction process forces the entry to be stored. This way you have control over the number of entries waiting to be stored, and thus you can prevent a possible OutOfMemory exception.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *`MapStore` or `MapLoader` implementations should not use Hazelcast Map/Queue/MultiMap/List/Set operations. Your implementation should only work with your data store. Otherwise, you may get into deadlock situations.*  Here is a sample configuration:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;map name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;     ...     &lt;map-store enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; initial-mode=\&quot;LAZY\&quot;&gt;       &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.examples.DummyStore&lt;/class-name&gt;       &lt;write-delay-seconds&gt;60&lt;/write-delay-seconds&gt;       &lt;write-batch-size&gt;1000&lt;/write-batch-size&gt;       &lt;write-coalescing&gt;true&lt;/write-coalescing&gt;     &lt;/map-store&gt;   &lt;/map&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  The following are the descriptions of MapStore configuration elements and attributes:  - `class-name`: Name of the class implementing MapLoader and/or MapStore. - `write-delay-seconds`: Number of seconds to delay to call the MapStore.store(key, value). If the value is zero then it is write-through so MapStore.store(key, value) will be called as soon as the entry is updated. Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds value by calling Hazelcast.storeAll(map). Default value is 0. - `write-batch-size`: Used to create batch chunks when writing map store. In default mode, all map entries will be tried to be written in one go. To create batch chunks, the minimum meaningful value for write-batch-size is 2. For values smaller than 2, it works as in default mode. - `write-coalescing`: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by default; it applies only the last update on it. You can set this element to `false` to store all updates performed on a key to the data store. - `enabled`: True to enable this map-store, false to disable. Default value is true. - `initial-mode`: Sets the initial load mode. LAZY is the default load mode, where load is asynchronous. EAGER means load is blocked till all partitions are loaded.

    body: "#### Storing Entries to Multiple Maps  A configuration can be applied to more than one map using wildcards (see [Using Wildcards](#using-wildcards)), meaning that the configuration is shared among the maps. But `MapStore` does not know which entries to store when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps.  To store entries when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps, use Hazelcast's `MapStoreFactory` interface. Using the `MapStoreFactory` interface, `MapStore`s for each map can be created when a wildcard configuration is used. Example code is shown below.  ```java Config config = new Config(); MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig( \&quot;*\&quot; ); MapStoreConfig mapStoreConfig = mapConfig.getMapStoreConfig(); mapStoreConfig.setFactoryImplementation( new MapStoreFactory&lt;Object, Object&gt;() {   @Override   public MapLoader&lt;Object, Object&gt; newMapStore( String mapName, Properties properties ) {     return null;   } }); ```  To initialize the `MapLoader` implementation with the given map name, configuration properties, and the Hazelcast instance, implement the `MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface. This interface has the methods `init()` and `destroy()` as shown below.  ```java public interface MapLoaderLifecycleSupport {    void init( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance, Properties properties, String mapName );    void destroy(); } ```  The method `init()` initializes the `MapLoader` implementation. Hazelcast calls this method when the map is first used on the Hazelcast instance. The `MapLoader` implementation can initialize the required resources for implementing `MapLoader` such as reading a configuration file or creating a database connection.  Hazelcast calls the method `destroy()` before shutting down. You can override this method  to cleanup the resources held by this `MapLoader` implementation, such as closing the database connections.    "

If `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` returns NULL, then nothing will be loaded. Your `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` implementation can return all or some of the keys. For example, you may select and return only the `hot` keys. `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` is the fastest way of pre-populating the map since Hazelcast will optimize the loading process by having each cluster member load its owned portion of the entries.  The `InitialLoadMode` configuration parameter in the class &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/MapStoreConfig.java\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;MapStoreConfig&lt;/a&gt; has two values: `LAZY` and `EAGER`. If `InitialLoadMode` is set to `LAZY`, data is not loaded during the map creation. If it is set to `EAGER`, all the data is loaded while the map is created, and everything becomes ready to use. Also, if you add indices to your map with the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/MapIndexConfig.java\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;MapIndexConfig&lt;/a&gt; class or the [`addIndex`](#indexing-queries) method, then `InitialLoadMode` is overridden and `MapStoreConfig` behaves as if `EAGER` mode is on.  Here is the `MapLoader` initialization flow:  1. When `getMap()` is first called from any member, initialization will start depending on the value of `InitialLoadMode`. If it is set to `EAGER`, initialization starts on all partitions as soon as the map is touched, i.e., all partitions will be loaded when `getMap` is called.  If it is set to `LAZY`, data will be loaded partition by partition, i.e., each partition will be loaded with its first touch. 2. Hazelcast will call `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` to get all your keys on one of the members. 3. That member will distribute keys to all other members in batches. 4. Each member will load values of all its owned keys by calling `MapLoader.loadAll(keys)`. 5. Each member puts its owned entries into the map by calling `IMap.putTransient(key,value)`.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If the load mode is `LAZY` and the `clear()` method is called (which triggers `MapStore.deleteAll()`), Hazelcast will remove **ONLY** the loaded entries from your map and datastore.

For example, if you set its value as `3`, loading process will be blocked until all three members are completely up.*    ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The return type of `loadAllKeys()` is changed from `Set` to `Iterable` with the release of Hazelcast 3.5.

Hazelcast iterates over the `Iterable` and, while doing so, sends out the keys to their respective owner members.

You can define the database properties, such as its URL and name, using the `properties` configuration element.

To perform pessimistic locking, use the lock mechanism provided by the Hazelcast distributed map, i.e., the `map.lock` and `map.unlock` methods. See the below example code.  ```java public class PessimisticUpdateMember {     public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {         HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();         IMap&lt;String, Value&gt; map = hz.getMap( \&quot;map\&quot; );         String key = \&quot;1\&quot;;         map.put( key, new Value() );         System.out.println( \&quot;Starting\&quot; );         for ( int k = 0; k &lt; 1000; k++ ) {             map.lock( key );             try {                 Value value = map.get( key );                 Thread.sleep( 10 );                 value.amount++;                 map.put( key, value );             } finally {                 map.unlock( key );             }         }         System.out.println( \&quot;Finished!

The IMap lock is reentrant, but it does not support fairness.  Another way to solve the race issue is by acquiring a predictable `Lock` object from Hazelcast. This way, every value in the map can be given a lock, or you can create a stripe of locks.   "

It is more robust than optimistic locking from the perspective of data consistency.  In Hazelcast, use `IExecutorService` to submit a task to a key owner, or to a member or members. This is the recommended way to perform task executions, rather than using pessimistic or optimistic locking techniques. `IExecutorService` will have fewer network hops and less data over wire, and tasks will be executed very near to the data.

The following actions will then check for lock quorum before being applied:   - `IMap#lock(K)` and `IMap#lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` - `IMap#isLocked` - `IMap#tryLock(K)`, `IMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` and `IMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` - `IMap#unlock` - `IMap#forceUnlock` - `MultiMap#lock(K)` and `MultiMap#lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` - `MultiMap#isLocked` - `MultiMap#tryLock(K)`, `MultiMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` and `MultiMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` - `MultiMap#unlock` - `MultiMap#forceUnlock`   An example of declarative configuration:   ```xml &lt;map name=\&quot;myMap\&quot;&gt;   &lt;quorum-ref&gt;map-actions-quorum&lt;/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;/map&gt;  &lt;lock name=\&quot;myMap\&quot;&gt;     &lt;quorum-ref&gt;map-lock-actions-quorum&lt;/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;/lock&gt; ```  Here the configured map will use the `map-lock-actions-quorum` quorum for map lock actions and the `map-actions-quorum` quorum for other map actions."

Please see the [Listening for Map Events section](#listening-for-map-events) for information on how to add entry listeners to a map.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***IMPORTANT:*** *The default backwards-compatible event publishing strategy only publishes `UPDATED` events when map entries are updated to a value that matches the predicate with which the listener was registered. This implies that when using the default event publishing strategy, your listener will not be notified about an entry whose value is updated from one that matches the predicate to a new value that does not match the predicate.*  Since version 3.7, when you configure Hazelcast members with property `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types` set to `true`, handling of entry updates conceptually treats value transition as entry, update or exit with regards to the predicate value space. The following table compares how a listener is notified about an update to a map entry value under the default backwards-compatible Hazelcast behavior (when property `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types` is not set or is set to `false`) versus when set to `true`:  &amp;nbsp; | Default | `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types = true` :--------------|:---------------|:------ When old value matches predicate,&lt;br/&gt;new value does not match predicate | No event is delivered to entry listener | `REMOVED` event is delivered to entry listener When old value matches predicate,&lt;br/&gt;new value matches predicate | `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener | `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener When old value does not match predicate,&lt;br/&gt;new value does not match predicate | No event is delivered to entry listener | No event is delivered to entry listener When old value does not match predicate,&lt;br/&gt;new value matches predicate | `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener | `ADDED` event is delivered to entry listener     As an example, let's listen to the changes made on an employee with the surname \&quot;Smith\&quot;. First, let's create the `Employee` class.  ```java import java.io.Serializable;  public class Employee implements Serializable {      private final String surname;      public Employee(String surname) {         this.surname = surname;     }      @Override     public String toString() {         return \&quot;Employee{\&quot; +                 \&quot;surname='\&quot; + surname + '\'' +                 '}';     } } ```  Then, let's create a listener with predicate by adding a listener that tracks `ADDED`, `UPDATED` and `REMOVED` entry events with the `surname` predicate.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.*; import com.hazelcast.query.SqlPredicate;  public class ListenerWithPredicate {      public static void main(String[] args) {         Config config = new Config();         config.setProperty(\&quot;hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types\&quot;, \&quot;true\&quot;);         HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);         IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap(\&quot;map\&quot;);         map.addEntryListener(new MyEntryListener(),                 new SqlPredicate(\&quot;surname=smith\&quot;), true);         System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Listener registered\&quot;);     }      static class MyEntryListener             implements EntryAddedListener&lt;String, String&gt;,                        EntryUpdatedListener&lt;String, String&gt;,                        EntryRemovedListener&lt;String, String&gt; {         @Override         public void entryAdded(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Added:\&quot; + event);         }          @Override         public void entryRemoved(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event); {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Removed:\&quot; + event);         }          @Override         public void entryUpdated(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Updated:\&quot; + event);         }              } } ```  And now, let's play with the employee \&quot;smith\&quot; and see how that employee will be listened to.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;  public class Modify {      public static void main(String[] args) {         Config config = new Config();         config.setProperty(\&quot;hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types\&quot;, \&quot;true\&quot;);         HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);         IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; map = hz.getMap(\&quot;map\&quot;);          map.put(\&quot;1\&quot;, new Employee(\&quot;smith\&quot;));         map.put(\&quot;2\&quot;, new Employee(\&quot;jordan\&quot;));         System.out.println(\&quot;done\&quot;);         System.exit(0);     } } ```  When you first run the class `ListenerWithPredicate` and then run `Modify`, you will see output similar to the listing below.  ``` entryAdded:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.178.10]:5702} key=1,oldValue=null, value=Person{name= smith }, event=ADDED, by Member [192.168.178.10]:5702 ```  ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please refer to [Continuous Query Cache](#continuous-query-cache) for more information.*     "

    body: "### Adding Interceptors  You can add intercept operations and execute your own business logic synchronously blocking the operations. You can change the returned value from a `get` operation, change the value in `put`, or `cancel` operations by throwing an exception.  Interceptors are different from listeners. With listeners, you take an action after the operation has been completed. Interceptor actions are synchronous and you can alter the behavior of operation, change its values, or totally cancel it.  Map interceptors are chained, so adding the same interceptor multiple times to the same map can result in duplicate effects. This can easily happen when the interceptor is added to the map at member initialization, so that each member adds the same interceptor. When you add the interceptor in this way, be sure to implement the `hashCode()` method to return the same value for every instance of the interceptor. It is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea to also implement `equals()` as this will ensure that the map interceptor can be removed reliably.  The IMap API has two methods for adding and removing an interceptor to the map: `addInterceptor` and `removeInterceptor`.  ```java /**  * Adds an interceptor for the map. Added interceptor intercepts operations  * and executes user defined methods and cancels operations if   * user defined methods throw exceptions.   *  * @param interceptor map interceptor.  * @return id of registered interceptor.  */ String addInterceptor( MapInterceptor interceptor );  /**  * Removes the given interceptor for this map.

For example, on a cluster with five members having 10 GB of data and 25 GB heap size per member, a single call of `IMap.entrySet()` fetches 50 GB of data and crashes the calling instance.  A call of `IMap.values()` may return too much data for a single member. This can also happen with a real query and an unlucky choice of predicates, especially when the parameters are chosen by a user of your application.  To prevent this, you can configure a maximum result size limit for query based operations. This is not a limit like `SELECT * FROM map LIMIT 100`, which you can achieve by a [Paging Predicate](#filtering-with-paging-predicates). A maximum result size limit for query based operations is meant to be a last line of defense to prevent your members from retrieving more data than they can handle.  The Hazelcast component which calculates this limit is the `QueryResultSizeLimiter`.  "

You should consider the following to understand the `itemId` assignment behavior:  - When a Hazelcast member has a queue, and that queue is configured to have at least one backup, and that member is restarted, the `itemId` assignment resumes from the last known highest `itemId` before the restart; `itemId` assignment does not start from the beginning for the new items. - When the whole cluster is restarted, the same behavior explained in the above consideration applies if your queue has a persistent data store (`QueueStore`). If the queue has `QueueStore`, the `itemId` for the new items are given, starting from the highest `itemId` found in the IDs returned by the method `loadAllKeys`. If the method `loadAllKeys` does not return anything, the `itemId`s will started from the beginning after a cluster restart. - The above two considerations mean there will be no duplicated `itemId`s in the memory or in the persistent data store.

    title: "Setting a Bounded Queue",
    body: "### Setting a Bounded Queue  A bounded queue is a queue with a limited capacity. When the bounded queue is full, no more items can be put into the queue until some items are taken out.  To turn a Hazelcast distributed queue into a bounded queue, set the capacity limit with the `max-size` property. You can set the `max-size` property in the configuration, as shown below. `max-size` specifies the maximum size of the queue. Once the queue size reaches this value, `put` operations will be blocked until the queue size goes below `max-size`, which happens when a consumer removes items from the queue.  Let's set **10** as the maximum size of our example queue in [Creating an Example Queue](#creating-an-example-queue).   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;queue name=\&quot;queue\&quot;&gt;     &lt;max-size&gt;10&lt;/max-size&gt;   &lt;/queue&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  When the producer is started, ten items are put into the queue and then the queue will not allow more `put` operations. When the consumer is started, it will remove items from the queue. This means that the producer can `put` more items into the queue until there are ten items in the queue again, at which point the `put` operation again becomes blocked.  In this example code, the producer is five times faster than the consumer. It will effectively always be waiting for the consumer to remove items before it can put more on the queue. For this example code, if maximum throughput is the goal, it would be a good option to start multiple consumers to prevent the queue from filling up.    "

    title: "Queueing with Persistent Datastore",
    body: "### Queueing with Persistent Datastore   Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed queue items from/to a persistent datastore using the interface `QueueStore`. If queue store is enabled, each item added to the queue will also be stored at the configured queue store. When the number of items in the queue exceeds the memory limit, the subsequent items are persisted in the queue store, they are not stored in the queue memory.  The `QueueStore` interface enables you to store, load, and delete queue items with methods like `store`, `storeAll`, `load` and `delete`. The following example class includes all of the `QueueStore` methods.  ```java public class TheQueueStore implements QueueStore&lt;Item&gt; {     @Override     public void delete(Long key) {         System.out.println(\&quot;delete\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void store(Long key, Item value) {         System.out.println(\&quot;store\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void storeAll(Map&lt;Long, Item&gt; map) {         System.out.println(\&quot;store all\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void deleteAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) {         System.out.println(\&quot;deleteAll\&quot;);     }      @Override     public Item load(Long key) {         System.out.println(\&quot;load\&quot;);         return null;     }      @Override     public Map&lt;Long, Item&gt; loadAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) {         System.out.println(\&quot;loadAll\&quot;);         return null;     }      @Override     public Set&lt;Long&gt; loadAllKeys() {         System.out.println(\&quot;loadAllKeys\&quot;);         return null;     } ```   `Item` must be serializable. The following is an example queue store configuration.   ```xml &lt;queue-store&gt;   &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.QueueStoreImpl&lt;/class-name&gt;   &lt;properties&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;binary\&quot;&gt;false&lt;/property&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;memory-limit\&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/property&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;bulk-load\&quot;&gt;500&lt;/property&gt;   &lt;/properties&gt; &lt;/queue-store&gt; ```  Let's explain the queue store properties.  - **Binary**: By default, Hazelcast stores the queue items in serialized form, and before it inserts the queue items into the , it deserializes them. If you are not reaching the queue store from an external application, you might prefer that the items be inserted in binary form. Do this by setting the `binary` property to true: then you can get rid of the deserialization step, which is a performance optimization. The `binary` property is false by default.      - **Memory Limit**: This is the number of items after which Hazelcast will store items only to the datastore. For example, if the memory limit is 1000, then the 1001st item will be put only to the datastore. This feature is useful when you want to avoid out-of-memory conditions. If you want to always use memory, you can set it to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The default number for `memory-limit` is 1000.      - **Bulk Load**: When the queue is initialized, items are loaded from `QueueStore` in bulks. Bulk load is the size of these bulks. The default value of `bulk-load` is 250.   "

By having this backup, when a cluster member with a queue goes down, another member having the backup of that queue will continue. Therefore, no items are lost. You can define the number of synchronous backups for a queue using the `backup-count` element in the declarative configuration. A queue can also have asynchronous backups: you can define the number of asynchronous backups using the `async-backup-count` element.  To set the maximum size of the queue, use the `max-size` element. To purge unused or empty queues after a period of time, use the `empty-queue-ttl` element. If you define a value (time in seconds) for the `empty-queue-ttl` element, then your queue will be destroyed if it stays empty or unused for the time in seconds that you give.  The following is the full list of queue configuration elements with their descriptions.  - `max-size`: Maximum number of items in the queue. It is used to set an upper bound for the queue. You will not be able to put more items when the queue reaches to this maximum size whether you have a queue store configured or not. - `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups. Queue is a non-partitioned data structure, so all entries of a queue reside in one partition. When this parameter is '1', it means there will be one backup of that queue in another member in the cluster. When it is '2', two members will have the backup. - `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups. - `empty-queue-ttl`: Used to purge unused or empty queues. If you define a value (time in seconds) for this element, then your queue will be destroyed if it stays empty or unused for that time. - `item-listeners`: Adds listeners (listener classes) for the queue items. You can also set the attribute `include-value` to `true` if you want the item event to contain the item values, and you can set `local` to `true` if you want to listen to the items on the local member. - `queue-store`: Includes the queue store factory class name and the properties  *binary*, *memory limit* and *bulk load*. Please refer to [Queueing with Persistent Datastore](#queueing-with-persistent-datastore). - `statistics-enabled`: If set to `true`, you can retrieve statistics for this queue using the method `getLocalQueueStats()`. - `quorum-ref` : Name of quorum configuration that you want this queue to use.

    body: "### IQueue vs. Ringbuffer  Hazelcast Ringbuffer can sometimes be a better alternative than an Hazelcast IQueue. Unlike IQueue, Ringbuffer does not remove the items, it only reads items using a certain position. There are many advantages to this approach:  * The same item can be read multiple times by the same thread. This is useful for realizing semantics of read-at-least-once or  read-at-most-once. * The same item can be read by multiple threads. Normally you could use an IQueue per thread for the same semantic, but this is  less efficient because of the increased remoting. A take from an IQueue is destructive, so the change needs to be applied for backup  also, which is why a `queue.take()` is more expensive than a `ringBuffer.read(...)`. * Reads are extremely cheap since there is no change in the Ringbuffer. Therefore no replication is required.  * Reads and writes can be batched to speed up performance. Batching can dramatically improve the performance of Ringbuffer.    "

If  a `time-to-live` is configured, then an array of longs is also created that stores the expiration time for every item.  In a lot of cases you may want to change this `capacity` number to something that better fits your needs.   Below is a declarative configuration example of a Ringbuffer with a `capacity` of 2000 items.  ```xml &lt;ringbuffer name=\&quot;rb\&quot;&gt;     &lt;capacity&gt;2000&lt;/capacity&gt; &lt;/ringbuffer&gt; ```  Currently, Hazelcast Ringbuffer is not a partitioned data structure; its data is stored in a single partition and the replicas  are stored in another partition.

In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with no synchronous backups and one asynchronous backup:  ```xml &lt;ringbuffer name=\&quot;rb\&quot;&gt;     &lt;backup-count&gt;0&lt;/backup-count&gt;     &lt;async-backup-count&gt;1&lt;/async-backup-count&gt; &lt;/ringbuffer&gt; ```  An asynchronous backup will probably give you better performance. However, there is a chance that the item added will be lost  when the member owning the primary crashes before the backup could complete.

    body: "### Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore  Hazelcast allows you to load and store the Ringbuffer items from/to a persistent datastore using the interface `RingbufferStore`. If a Ringbuffer store is enabled, each item added to the Ringbuffer will also be stored at the configured Ringbuffer store.   If the Ringbuffer store is configured, you can get items with sequences which are no longer in the actual Ringbuffer but are only in the Ringbuffer store. This will probably be much slower but still allow you to continue consuming items from the Ringbuffer even if they are overwritten with newer items in the Ringbuffer.  When a Ringbuffer is being instantiated, it will check if the Ringbuffer store is configured and will request the latest sequence in the Ringbuffer store. This is to enable the Ringbuffer to start with sequences larger than the ones in the Ringbuffer store. In this case, the Ringbuffer is empty but you can still request older items from it (which will be loaded from the Ringbuffer store).  The Ringbuffer store will store items in the same format as the Ringbuffer. If the `BINARY` in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface `RingbufferStore&lt;byte[]&gt;` meaning that the Ringbuffer will receive items in the binary format. If the `OBJECT` in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface `RingbufferStore&lt;K&gt;`, where `K` is the type of item being stored (meaning that the Ringbuffer store will receive the deserialized object).  When adding items to the Ringbuffer, the method `storeAll` allows you to store items in batches.  The following example class includes all of the `RingbufferStore` methods.  ```java public class TheRingbufferObjectStore implements RingbufferStore&lt;Item&gt; {      @Override     public void store(long sequence, Item data) {         System.out.println(\&quot;Object store\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void storeAll(long firstItemSequence, Item[] items) {         System.out.println(\&quot;Object store all\&quot;);     }      @Override     public Item load(long sequence) {         System.out.println(\&quot;Object load\&quot;);         return null;     }      @Override     public long getLargestSequence() {         System.out.println(\&quot;Object get largest sequence\&quot;);         return -1;     } } ```   `Item` must be serializable. The following is an example of a Ringbuffer with the Ringbuffer store configured and enabled.   ```xml     &lt;ringbuffer name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;         &lt;capacity&gt;10000&lt;/capacity&gt;         &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;30&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt;         &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;/backup-count&gt;         &lt;async-backup-count&gt;0&lt;/async-backup-count&gt;         &lt;in-memory-format&gt;BINARY&lt;/in-memory-format&gt;         &lt;ringbuffer-store&gt;             &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.RingbufferStoreImpl&lt;/class-name&gt;         &lt;/ringbuffer-store&gt;     &lt;/ringbuffer&gt; ```  Below are the explanations for the Ringbuffer store configuration elements:   - **class-name**: Name of the class implementing the `RingbufferStore` interface.       - **factory-class-name**: Name of the class implementing the `RingbufferStoreFactory` interface. This interface allows a factory class to be registered instead of a class implementing the `RingbufferStore` interface.

The method `readManyAsync` can read a batch of items and can filter items at the source.

If you do not want to block, set it to 0. If you want to block for at least one item, set it to 1. * `maxCount`: Maximum number of the items to retrieve. Its value cannot exceed 1000. * `filter`: A function that accepts an item and checks if it should be returned. If no filtering should be applied, set it to null.

Moreover, when a member leaves the cluster, all the locks acquired by that dead member will be removed so that those locks are immediately available for live members.  - Locks are re-entrant. The same thread can lock multiple times on the same lock. Note that for other threads to be  able to require this lock, the owner of the lock must call `unlock` as many times as the owner called `lock`.  - In the split-brain scenario, the cluster behaves as if it were two different clusters. Since two separate clusters are not aware of each other, two members from different clusters can acquire the same lock. For more information on places where split brain syndrome can be handled, please see [split brain syndrome](#network-partitioning-split-brain-syndrome).  - Locks are not automatically removed. If a lock is not used anymore, Hazelcast will not automatically garbage collect the lock.  This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`. If you create locks on the fly, make sure they are destroyed.  - Hazelcast IMap also provides locking support on the entry level with the method `IMap.lock(key)`.

This is a check to avoid performing successful lock operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition. Due to the implementation details, the check does not guarantee that the lock will fail in all conditions of a network partition and it can happen that two members can acquire the same lock.  Once the membership change has been detected, the lock operations will fail with a `QuorumException` if enough size of members are not present. In essence, this does not provide correctness but rather narrows down the window of opportunity in which locks can continue operations on several members concurrently.  Although the check does not provide correctness it can still be useful. In cases where members acquire the lock to perform some costly but idempotent operation, configuring lock quorum can further prevent some cases where the cluster has been split into several sub-clusters and more than one member perform the same operation.  Following is a list of methods that now support quorum checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

It is also important to know that if you rely on Java serialization, sometimes (especially with hashmaps) the same object can result in different binary content. -	`IAtomicReference` will always have one synchronous backup. -	All methods returning an object will return a private copy. You can modify the private copy, but the rest of the world will be shielded from your changes. If you want these changes to be visible to the rest of the world, you need to write the change back to the `IAtomicReference`; but be careful about introducing a data-race.  -	The 'in-memory format' of an `IAtomicReference` is `binary`. The receiving side does not need to have the class definition available unless it needs to be deserialized on the other side, e.g., because a method like 'alter' is executed. This deserialization is done for every call that needs to have the object instead of the binary content, so be careful with expensive object graphs that need to be deserialized. -	If you have an object with many fields or an object graph, and you only need to calculate some information or need a subset of fields, you can use the `apply` method. With the `apply` method, the whole object does not need to be sent over the line; only the information that is relevant is sent. "

It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations.  The following code samples describe the mechanism of `ICountDownLatch`. Assume that there is a leader process and there are follower processes that will wait until the leader completes. Here is the leader:  ```java public class Leader {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     ICountDownLatch latch = hazelcastInstance.getCountDownLatch( \&quot;countDownLatch\&quot; );     System.out.println( \&quot;Starting\&quot; );     latch.trySetCount( 1 );     Thread.sleep( 30000 );     latch.countDown();     System.out.println( \&quot;Leader finished\&quot; );     latch.destroy();   } } ```  Since only a single step is needed to be completed as a sample, the above code initializes the latch with 1. Then, the code sleeps for a while to simulate a process and starts the countdown. Finally, it clears up the latch. Let's write a follower:   ```java public class Follower {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     ICountDownLatch latch = hazelcastInstance.getCountDownLatch( \&quot;countDownLatch\&quot; );     System.out.println( \&quot;Waiting\&quot; );     boolean success = latch.await( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS );     System.out.println( \&quot;Complete: \&quot; + success );   } }  ```  The follower class above first retrieves `ICountDownLatch` and then calls the `await` method to enable the thread to listen for the latch. The method `await` has a timeout value as a parameter. This is useful when the `countDown` method fails. To see `ICountDownLatch` in action, start the leader first and then start one or more followers. You will see that the followers will wait until the leader completes.  "

If a cluster member uses all IDs in the group, it will get another 10,000 IDs. This way, only one time of network traffic is needed, meaning that 9,999 identifiers are generated in memory instead of over the network. This is fast.  Let's write a sample identifier generator.  ```java public class IdGeneratorExample {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     IdGenerator idGen = hazelcastInstance.getIdGenerator( \&quot;newId\&quot; );     while (true) {       Long id = idGen.newId();       System.err.println( \&quot;Id: \&quot; + id );       Thread.sleep( 1000 );     }   } } ```  Let's run the above code two times.

    body: "### Considerations for Replicated Map  If you have a large cluster or very high occurrences of updates, the Replicated Map may not scale linearly as expected since it has to replicate update operations to all members in the cluster.  Since the replication of updates is performed in an asynchronous manner, we recommend you enable back pressure in case your system has high occurrences of updates. Please refer to the [Back Pressure](#back-pressure) section to learn how to enable it.  Replicated Map has an anti-entropy system that will converge values to a common one if some of the members are missing replication updates.  Replicated Map does not guarantee eventual consistency because there are some edge cases that fail to provide consistency.  Replicated Map uses the internal partition system of Hazelcast in order to serialize updates happening on the same key at the same time. This happens by sending updates of the same key to the same Hazelcast member in the cluster.  Due to the asynchronous nature of replication, a Hazelcast member could die before successfully replicating a \&quot;write\&quot; operation to other members after sending the \&quot;write completed\&quot; response to its caller during the write process. In this scenario, Hazelcast's internal partition system will promote one of the replicas of the partition as the primary one. The new primary partition will not have the latest \&quot;write\&quot; since the dead member could not successfully replicate the update. (This will leave the system in a state that the caller is the only one that has the update and the rest of the cluster have not.) In this case even the anti-entropy system simply could not converge the value since the source of true information is lost for the update. This leads to a break in the eventual consistency because different values can be read from the system for the same key.  Other than the aforementioned scenario, the Replicated Map will behave like an eventually consistent system with read-your-writes and monotonic-reads consistency.   "

Each involves how you configure the async fill up.  First, you can configure async fill up to true, which does not block reads while the fill up operation is underway. That way, you have immediate access on the new member, but it will take time until all the values are eventually accessible. Not yet replicated values are returned as non-existing (null).  Second, you can configure for a synchronous initial fill up (by configuring the async fill up to false), which blocks every read or write access to the map until the fill up operation is finished.

    body: "## Event Journal  The event journal is a distributed data structure that stores the history of mutation actions on map or cache. Each action on the map or cache which modifies its contents (such as `put`, `remove` or scheduled tasks which are not triggered by using the public API) will create an event which will be stored in the event journal. The event will store the event type as well as the key, old value and updated value for the entry (when applicable). As a user, you can only append to the journal indirectly by using the map and cache methods or by configuring expiration and eviction.  By reading from the event journal you can recreate the state of the map or cache at any point in time.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg)***NOTE:*** *Currently the event journal does not expose a public API for reading the event journal in Hazelcast IMDG. The event journal should be used in conjunction with [Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org/). Because of this we will describe how to configure it but not how to use it from IMDG. If you enable and configure the event journal, you may only reach it through private API and you will most probably not get any benefits but the journal will retain events nevertheless and consume heap space.*  The event journal has a fixed capacity and an expiration time. Internally it is structured as a ringbuffer (partitioned by ringbuffer item) and shares many similarities with it.   "

You can run into issues if you are reading from the event journal and the partition owner is terminated. A backup replica will then be promoted into the partition owner but the event journal will contain different events. The event count should stay the same but the entries which you previously thought were evicted and expired could now be \&quot;alive\&quot; and vice versa.  This is because eviction and expiration randomly choose entries to be evicted/expired. The entry is not coordinated between partition replicas. In these cases, the event journal diverges and will not converge at any future point but will remain inconsistent just as well as the contents of the internal record stores are inconsistent between replicas. You may say that the event journal on a specific replica is in-sync with the record store on that replica but the event journals and record stores between replicas are out-of-sync.  "

    body: "#### Configuring Event Journal Capacity  By default, an event journal is configured with a `capacity` of 10000 items. This creates a single array per partition, roughly the size of the capacity divided by the number of partitions. Thus, if the configured capacity is 10000 and the number of partitions is 271, we will create 271 arrays of size 36 (10000/271). If  a `time-to-live` is configured, then an array of longs is also created that stores the expiration time for every item.  A single array of the event journal keeps events that are only related to the map entries in that partition. In a lot of cases you may want to change this `capacity` number to something that better fits your needs. As the capacity is shared between partitions, keep in mind not to set it to a value which is too low for you. Setting the capacity to a number lower than the partition count will result in an error when initializing the event journal.   Below is a declarative configuration example of an event journal with a `capacity` of 2000 items:  ```xml &lt;event-journal enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;     &lt;mapName&gt;myMap&lt;/mapName&gt;     &lt;capacity&gt;5000&lt;/capacity&gt;     &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;20&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt; &lt;/event-journal&gt;  &lt;event-journal enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;     &lt;cacheName&gt;myCache&lt;/cacheName&gt;     &lt;capacity&gt;10000&lt;/capacity&gt;     &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;0&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt; &lt;/event-journal&gt; ```   You can also configure an event journal programmatically. The following is a programmatic version of the above declarative configuration:  ```java EventJournalConfig myMapJournalConfig = new EventJournalConfig()                 .setMapName(\&quot;myMap\&quot;)                 .setEnabled(true)                 .setCapacity(5000)                 .setTimeToLiveSeconds(20);          EventJournalConfig myCacheJournalConfig = new EventJournalConfig()                 .setMapName(\&quot;myCache\&quot;)                 .setEnabled(true)                 .setCapacity(10000)                 .setTimeToLiveSeconds(0);                  Config config = new Config();         config.addEventJournalConfig(myMapJournalConfig);         config.addEventJournalConfig(myCacheJournalConfig); ```   The `mapName` and `cacheName` attributes define the map or cache to which this event journal configuration applies. You can use pattern-matching and the `default` keyword when doing so. For instance, by using a `mapName` of `journaled*`, the journal configuration will apply to all maps whose names start with \&quot;journaled\&quot; and don't have other journal configurations that match (e.g., if you would have a more specific journal configuration with an exact name match). If you specify the `mapName` or `cacheName` as `default`, the journal configuration will apply to all maps and caches that don't have any other journal configuration. This means that potentially all maps and/or caches will have one single event journal configuration.   "

If the journal is not being read or written to, the journal may keep expired items indefinitely.   In the example below, an event journal is configured with a `time-to-live` of 180 seconds:  ```xml &lt;event-journal enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;     &lt;cacheName&gt;myCache&lt;/cacheName&gt;     &lt;capacity&gt;10000&lt;/capacity&gt;     &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;180&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt; &lt;/event-journal&gt; ```  "

N1 is owner of partition-0, and N2 and N3 are the first and second replicas respectively. If N1 and N2 crash simultaneously, partition-0 loses its data that is configured with less than two backups. For instance, if we configure a map with one backup, that map loses its data in partition-0 since both owner and first replica of partition-0 have crashed. However, if we configure our map with two backups, it does not lose any data since a copy of partition-0's data for the given map also resides in N3.   The Partition Lost Listener notifies for possible data loss occurrences with the information of how many replicas are lost for a partition. It listens to `PartitionLostEvent` instances. Partition lost events are dispatched per partition.   Partition loss detection is done after a member crash is detected by the other members and the crashed member is removed from the cluster.

To listen to these events, implement a `MapListener` sub-interface.  A map-wide event is fired as a result of a map-wide operation. For  example, `IMap#clear` or `IMap#evictAll`. An entry-based event is fired after the operations that affect a  specific entry. For example, `IMap#remove` or `IMap#evict`.  "

However, if you need to listen to a  different event, one that is not available in the `EntryListener` interface, you should also  implement a relevant `MapListener` sub-interface.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  Let's take a look at the following class example.    ```java public class Listen {    public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap( \&quot;somemap\&quot; );     map.addEntryListener( new MyEntryListener(), true );      System.out.println( \&quot;EntryListener registered\&quot; );   }    static class MyEntryListener implements EntryAddedListener&lt;String, String&gt;,                                            EntryRemovedListener&lt;String, String&gt;,                                            EntryUpdatedListener&lt;String, String&gt;,                                            EntryEvictedListener&lt;String, String&gt; ,                                            MapEvictedListener,                                            MapClearedListener   {     @Override     public void entryAdded( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Entry Added:\&quot; + event );     }      @Override     public void entryRemoved( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Entry Removed:\&quot; + event );     }      @Override     public void entryUpdated( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Entry Updated:\&quot; + event );     }      @Override     public void entryEvicted( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Entry Evicted:\&quot; + event );     }      @Override     public void mapEvicted( MapEvent event ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Map Evicted:\&quot; + event );     }         @Override     public void mapCleared( MapEvent event ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Map Cleared:\&quot; + event );     }    } } ```  Now, let's perform some modifications on the map entries using the following example code.  ```java public class Modify {    public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap( \&quot;somemap\&quot;);     String key = \&quot;\&quot; + System.nanoTime();     String value = \&quot;1\&quot;;     map.put( key, value );     map.put( key, \&quot;2\&quot; );     map.delete( key );   } } ```  If you execute the `Listen` class and then the `Modify` class, you get the following output  produced by the `Listen` class.   ``` entryAdded:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.1.100]:5702} key=251359212222282,     oldValue=null, value=1, event=ADDED, by Member [192.168.1.100]:5702  entryUpdated:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.1.100]:5702} key=251359212222282,     oldValue=1, value=2, event=UPDATED, by Member [192.168.1.100]:5702  entryRemoved:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.1.100]:5702} key=251359212222282,     oldValue=2, value=2, event=REMOVED, by Member [192.168.1.100]:5702 ```   ```java public class MyEntryListener implements EntryListener{      private Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);      @Override     public void entryAdded(EntryEvent event) {         executor.execute(new DoSomethingWithEvent(event));     } ... ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Please note that the method `IMap.clear()` does not fire an \&quot;EntryRemoved\&quot; event, but fires a \&quot;MapCleared\&quot; event.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   "

This striped executor also guarantees the event order. For all events in Hazelcast, the order in which events are generated and the order in which they are published are guaranteed for given keys. For map and multimap, the order is preserved for the operations on the same key of the entry. For list, set, topic and queue, the order is preserved for events on that instance of the distributed data structure.  To achieve the order guarantee, you make only one thread responsible for a particular set of events (entry events of a key in a map, item events of a collection, etc.) in `StripedExecutor` (within `com.hazelcast.util.executor`).  If the event queue reaches its capacity (`hazelcast.event.queue.capacity`) and the last item cannot be put into the event queue for the period specified in `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis`, these events will be dropped with a warning message, such as \&quot;EventQueue overloaded\&quot;.  If event listeners perform a computation that takes a long time, the event queue can reach its maximum capacity and lose events. For map and multimap, you can configure `hazelcast.event.thread.count` to a higher value so that fewer collisions occur for keys, and therefore worker threads will not block each other in `StripedExecutor`. For list, set, topic and queue, you should offload heavy work to another thread. To preserve order guarantee, you should implement similar logic with `StripedExecutor` in the offloaded thread pool. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;   "

In distributed systems, this implementation is not desired since you may want a task submitted in one JVM and processed in another one. Hazelcast offers `IExecutorService` for you to use in distributed environments. It implements `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` to serve the applications requiring computational and data processing power.  With `IExecutorService`, you can execute tasks asynchronously and perform other useful tasks. If your task execution takes longer than expected, you can cancel the task execution. Tasks should be `Serializable` since they will be distributed.  In the Java Executor framework, you implement tasks two ways: Callable or Runnable.  * Callable: If you need to return a value and submit it to Executor, implement the task as `java.util.concurrent.Callable`. * Runnable: If you do not need to return a value, implement the task as `java.util.concurrent.Runnable`.

Below is an example of a Callable task. SumTask prints out map keys and returns the summed map values.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceAware; import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;  import java.io.Serializable; import java.util.concurrent.Callable;  public class SumTask     implements Callable&lt;Integer&gt;, Serializable, HazelcastInstanceAware {            private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;    public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) {     this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;   }    public Integer call() throws Exception {     IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;map\&quot; );     int result = 0;     for ( String key : map.localKeySet() ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;Calculating for key: \&quot; + key );       result += map.get( key );     }     System.out.println( \&quot;Local Result: \&quot; + result );     return result;   } } ```  Another example is the Echo callable below. In its call() method, it returns the local member and the input passed in. Remember that `instance.getCluster().getLocalMember()` returns the local member and `toString()` returns the member's address (IP + port) in String form, just to see which member actually executed the code for our example. Of course, the `call()` method can do and return anything you like.   ```java import java.util.concurrent.Callable; import java.io.Serializable;  public class Echo implements Callable&lt;String&gt;, Serializable {     String input = null;      public Echo() {     }      public Echo(String input) {         this.input = input;     }      public String call() {         Config cfg = new Config();         HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);         return instance.getCluster().getLocalMember().toString() + \&quot;:\&quot; + input;     } } ```  "

To scale up, you should improve the processing capacity of the cluster member (JVM). You can do this by increasing the `pool-size` property mentioned in [Configuring Executor Service](#configuring-executor-service) (i.e., increasing the thread count). However, please be aware of your member's capacity. If you think it cannot handle such an additional load caused by increasing the thread count, you may want to consider improving the member's resources (CPU, memory, etc.). As an example, set the `pool-size` to 5 and run the above `MasterMember`. You will see that `EchoTask` is run as soon as it is produced.   To scale out, add more members instead of increasing only one member's capacity. In reality, you may want to expand your cluster by adding more physical or virtual machines. For example, in the EchoTask example in the [Runnable section](#implementing-a-runnable-task), you can create another Hazelcast instance.

However, `fib(50)` will take much longer. (This is not an example for writing better Fibonacci calculation code, but for showing how to cancel a running execution that takes too long.) The method `future.cancel(false)` can only cancel execution before it is running (executing), but `future.cancel(true)` can interrupt running executions provided that your code is able to handle the interruption. If you are willing to cancel an already running task, then your task should be designed to handle interruptions.

Usually you execute these in the cluster based on the location of a key or a set of keys, or you allow Hazelcast to select a member.  If you want more control over where your code runs, use the `MemberSelector` interface. For example, you may want certain tasks to run only on certain members, or you may wish to implement some form of custom load balancing regime.  The `MemberSelector` is an interface that you can implement and then provide to the `IExecutorService` when you submit or execute.  The `select(Member)` method is called for every available member in the cluster. Implement this method to decide if the member is going to be used or not.  In a simple example shown below, we select the cluster members based on the presence of an attribute.  ```java public class MyMemberSelector implements MemberSelector {      public boolean select(Member member) {          return Boolean.TRUE.equals(member.getAttribute(\&quot;my.special.executor\&quot;));      }  } ```  You can use `MemberSelector` instances provided by the `com.hazelcast.cluster.memberselector.MemberSelectors` class.

    body: "## Durable Executor Service  Hazelcast's durable executor service is a data structure which is able to store an execution task both on the executing Hazelcast member and its backup member(s), if configured. By this way, you do not lose any tasks if a member goes down or any results if the submitter (member or client) goes down while executing the task. When using the durable executor service you can either submit or execute a task randomly or on the owner of a provided key. Note that in [executor service](#executor-service), you can submit or execute tasks to/on the selected member(s).  Processing of the tasks when using durable executor service involves two invocations:  1. Sending the task to primary Hazelcast member (primary partition) and to its backups, if configured, and executing the task. 2. Retrieving the result of the task.  As you may already know, Hazelcast's executor service returns a `future` representing the task to the user. With the above two-invocations approach, it is guaranteed that the task is executed before the `future` returns and you can track the response of a submitted task with a unique ID. Hazelcast stores the task on both primary and backup members, and starts the execution also.    With the first invocation, a [Ringbuffer](#ringbuffer) stores the task and a generated sequence for the task is returned to the caller as a result. In addition to the storing, the task is executed on the local execution service for the primary member. By this way, the task is now resilient to member failures and you are able to track the task with its ID.  After the first invocation has completed and the sequence of task is returned, second invocation starts to retrieve the result of task with that sequence. This retrieval waits in the waiting operations queue until notified, or it runs immediately if the result is already available.  When task execution is completed, Ringbuffer replaces the task with the result for the given task sequence. This replacement notifies the waiting operations queue.  "

Upon partition specific scheduling, the future task is stored both in the primary partition and also in its N backups, N being the `&lt;durability&gt;` property in the configuration. More specifically, there are always one or more backups to take ownership of the task in the event of a lost member. If a member is lost, the task will be re-scheduled on the backup (new primary) member, which might induce further delays on the subsequent executions of the task. For example, if we schedule a task to run in 10 seconds from now, `schedule(new ExampleTask(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);` and after 5 seconds the owner member goes down (before the execution takes place), then the backup owner will re-schedule the task in 10 seconds from now. Therefore, from the user's perspective waiting on the result, this will be available in `10 + 5 = 15` seconds rather than 10 seconds as it is anticipated originally. If `atFixedRate` was used, then only the initial delay is affected in the above scenario, all subsequent executions should adhere to the given period parameter.      2. Upon member specific scheduling, the future task is *only* stored in the member itself, which means that in the event of a lost member, the task will be lost as well.  To accomplish the described durability, all tasks provide a unique identity/name before the scheduling takes place. The name allows the service to reach the scheduled task even after the caller (client or member) goes down, and also allows helps to prevent duplicate tasks. The name of the task can be user-defined if it needs to be, by implementing the `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.NamedTask` interface (plain wrapper util is available here: `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.TaskUtils#named(java.lang.String, java.lang.Runnable)`). If the task does not provide a name in its implementation, the service provides a random UUID for it, internally.  Upon scheduling, the service returns an `IScheduledFuture` which on top of the `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture` functionality provides API to get the resource handler of the task `ScheduledTaskHandler` and also the runtime statistics of the task.  Futures associated with a scheduled task, in order to be aware of lost partitions and/or members, they act as listeners on the local member/client. Therefore, they are always strongly referenced, on the member/client side. In order to clean up their resources, once completed, one can use `dispose()`. Dispose will also cancel further executions of the task if scheduled at fixed rate. Please see below for your reference:  ``` package com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor;  import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture;  /**  * A delayed result-bearing action that can be cancelled.  * Usually a scheduled future is the result of scheduling  * a task with a IScheduledExecutorService.  *  * Enhances the default ScheduledFuture API with support  * of statistics and time measurement info, through ScheduledTaskStatistics.  */ public interface IScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt;         extends ScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; {      /**      * Returns the scheduled future resource handler.      * Can be used to re-acquire control of the IScheduledFuture using the      * IScheduledExecutorService#getScheduledFuture(ScheduledTaskHandler)      */     ScheduledTaskHandler getHandler();      /**      * Returns the statistics and time measurement info of the execution of this scheduled future      * in the IScheduledExecutorService it was scheduled.      */     ScheduledTaskStatistics getStats();      /**      * Used to destroy the instance of the IScheduledFuture in the scheduled executor.      * Once the instance is destroyed, any subsequent action on the {@link IScheduledFuture} will      * fail with an IllegalStateException.      * Attempting to re-create the IScheduledFuture from the      * IScheduledExecutorService#getScheduledFuture(ScheduledTaskHandler) using the #getHandler()      * will succeed, but any subsequent access on that new future, will also fail with StaleTaskException      */     void dispose();      /**      * Attempts to cancel further scheduling of this task.  This attempt will      * fail if the task has already completed, has already been cancelled,      * or could not be cancelled for some other reason.

Subsequent calls to #isCancelled      * will always return true if this method returned true.      */     boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning); } ```  The task handler, is a descriptor class holding information for the scheduled future, which is used to pinpoint the actual task in the cluster. It contains the name of the task, the owner (member or partition) and the scheduler name.   The handler is always available after scheduling and can be stored in a plain string format `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.ScheduledTaskHandler#toUrn` and re-constructed back from that String `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.ScheduledTaskHandler#of`. If the handler is lost, you can still find a task under a given scheduler by using the Scheduler's `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.IScheduledExecutorService#getAllScheduledFutures`.  Last but not least, similar to [executor service](#executor-service), the scheduled executor service allows Stateful tasks to be scheduled. Stateful tasks, are tasks that require any kind of state during their runtime, which must also be durable along with the task in the event of a lost partition.   Stateful tasks can be created by implementing the `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.StatefulTask` interface, and providing implementation details for saving the state and loading it back. If a partition is lost, then the re-scheduled task will load the previously saved state before its execution.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg)***NOTE:*** *As with the tasks, Objects stored in the state Map need to be Hazelcast serializable.*   "

An entry processor is a good option if you perform bulk processing on an `IMap`. Usually you perform a loop of keys-- executing `IMap.get(key)`, mutating the value, and finally putting the entry back in the map using `IMap.put(key,value)`.  If you perform this process from a client or from a member where the keys do not exist, you effectively perform two network hops for each update: the first to retrieve the data and the second to update the mutated value.  If you are doing the process described above, you should consider using entry processors. An entry processor executes a read and updates upon the member where the data resides.  This eliminates the costly network hops described above.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *Entry processor is meant to process a single entry per call. Processing multiple entries and data structures in an entry processor is not supported as it may result in deadlocks.*   "

The code below shows the Hazelcast `AbstractEntryProcessor` class. You can use it to create your own Abstract Entry Processor.  ```java public abstract class AbstractEntryProcessor &lt;K, V&gt;     implements EntryProcessor &lt;K, V&gt; {        private final EntryBackupProcessor &lt;K,V&gt; entryBackupProcessor;   public AbstractEntryProcessor() {     this(true);   }    public AbstractEntryProcessor(boolean applyOnBackup) {     if ( applyOnBackup ) {       entryBackupProcessor = new EntryBackupProcessorImpl();     } else {       entryBackupProcessor = null;     }   }     @Override   public abstract Object process(Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt; entry);    @Override   public final EntryBackupProcessor &lt;K, V&gt; getBackupProcessor() {     return entryBackupProcessor;   }    private class EntryBackupProcessorImpl implements EntryBackupProcessor &lt;K,V&gt;{     @Override     public void processBackup(Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt; entry) {       process(entry);      }   }	 } ```  In the above code, the method `getBackupProcessor` returns an `EntryBackupProcessor` instance. This means the same processing will be applied to both the primary and backup entries.

The design of entry processor assumes users have fast user code execution of the `process()` method. In the pathological case where the code that is very heavy and executes in multi-milliseconds, this may create a bottleneck.  We have a slow user code detector which can be used to log a warning controlled by the following system properties:  - `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.enabled` (default: true) - `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.threshold.millis` (default: 10000)  The defaults catch extremely slow operations but you should set this much lower, say to 1ms, at development time to catch entry processors that could be problematic in production. These are good candidates for our optimizations.  We have two optimizations:  - `Offloadable` which moves execution off the partition thread to an executor thread - `ReadOnly` which means we can avoid taking a lock on the key  These are enabled very simply by implementing these interfaces in your `EntryProcessor`.  As of 3.9, these optimizations apply to the following IMap methods only:  - `executeOnKey(Object, EntryProcessor)` - `submitToKey(Object, EntryProcessor)` - `submitToKey(Object, EntryProcessor, ExecutionCallback)`  "

Distributed query is highly scalable. If you add new members to the cluster, the partition count for each member is reduced and thus the time spent by each member on iterating its entries is reduced. In addition, the pool of partition threads evaluates the entries concurrently in each member, and the network traffic is also reduced since only filtered data is sent to the requester.

Also, you can sort the entries by specifying comparators.  In the example code below:  - The `greaterEqual` predicate gets values from the \&quot;students\&quot; map. This predicate has a filter to retrieve the objects with an \&quot;age\&quot; greater than or equal to 18.  - Then a `PagingPredicate` is constructed in which the page size is 5, so there will be five objects in each page.  The first time the values are called creates the first page.  - It gets subsequent pages with the `nextPage()` method of `PagingPredicate` and querying the map again with the updated `PagingPredicate`.   ```java IMap&lt;Integer, Student&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;students\&quot; ); Predicate greaterEqual = Predicates.greaterEqual( \&quot;age\&quot;, 18 ); PagingPredicate pagingPredicate = new PagingPredicate( greaterEqual, 5 ); // Retrieve the first page Collection&lt;Student&gt; values = map.values( pagingPredicate ); ... // Set up next page pagingPredicate.nextPage(); // Retrieve next page values = map.values( pagingPredicate ); ... ```  If a comparator is not specified for `PagingPredicate`, but you want to get a collection of keys or values page by page, this collection must be an instance of `Comparable` (i.e., it must implement `java.lang.Comparable`). Otherwise, the `java.lang.IllegalArgument` exception is thrown.  Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, you can also access a specific page more easily with the help of the method `setPage()`. This way, if you make a query for the hundredth page, for example, it will get all 100 pages at once instead of reaching the hundredth page one by one using the method `nextPage()`. Please note that this feature tires the memory and refer to the [PagingPredicate class](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/66263987a7bf4bec20217f3c555381a51712d017/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/query/PagingPredicate.java).

Each motorbike has two wheels so there are two names for each bike. In order to return both values from the extraction operation, collect them separately using the `ValueCollector`. Collecting multiple values in this way allows you to operate on these multiple values as if they were single values during the evaluation of the predicates.  Let's assume that we registered a custom extractor with the name `wheelName` and executed the following query: `wheelName = front-wheel`.  The extraction may return up to two wheel names for each `Motorbike` since each `Motorbike` has up to two wheels.

The parser will parse the string according to the parser's custom logic and it will return a parsed object. The parsed object may be a single object, array, collection, or any arbitrary object. It is up to the `ValueExtractor`'s implementor to understand the semantics of the parsed argument object.  For now it is **not** possible to register a custom `ArgumentParser`, thus a default parser is used.

With Hadoop as the most common and well known implementation, MapReduce gained a broad audience and made it into all kinds of business applications dominated by data warehouses.  MapReduce is a software framework for processing large amounts of data in a distributed way. Therefore, the processing is normally spread over several machines. The basic idea behind MapReduce is that source data is mapped into a collection of key-value pairs and reducing those pairs, grouped by key, in a second step towards the final result.  The main idea can be summarized with the following steps.    1. Read the source data.   2. Map the data to one or multiple key-value pairs.   3. Reduce all pairs with the same key.  **Use Cases**  The best known examples for MapReduce algorithms are text processing tools, such as counting the word frequency in large texts or websites. Apart from that, there are more interesting examples of use cases listed below.   - Log Analysis  - Data Querying  - Aggregation and summing  - Distributed Sort  - ETL (Extract Transform Load)  - Credit and Risk management  - Fraud detection  - and more.

From left to right, it iterates over all the entries of a data structure (in this case an IMap). In the mapping phase, it splits the sentence into single words and emits a key-value pair per word: the word is the key, 1 is the value. In the next phase, values are collected (grouped) and transported to their corresponding reducers, where they are eventually reduced to a single key-value pair, the value being the number of occurrences of the word. At the last step, the different reducer results are grouped up to the final result and returned to the requester.  ![MapReduce Workflow Example](images/MapReduceWorkflow.png)  In pseudo code, the corresponding map and reduce function would look like the following. A Hazelcast code example will be shown in the next section.  ```plain map( key:String, document:String ):Void -&gt;   for each w:word in document:     emit( w, 1 )  reduce( word:String, counts:List[Int] ):Int -&gt;   return sum( counts ) ```  "

    body: "#### MapReduce Phases  As seen in the workflow example, a MapReduce process consists of multiple phases. The original MapReduce pattern describes two phases (map, reduce) and one optional phase (combine). In Hazelcast, these phases either only exist virtually to explain the data flow, or are executed in parallel during the real operation while the general idea is still persisting.  (K x V)\* -&gt; (L x W)*  [(k*1*, v*1*), ..., (k*n*, v*n*)] -&gt; [(l*1*, w*1*), ..., (l*m*, w*m*)]  **Mapping Phase**  The mapping phase iterates all key-value pairs of any kind of legal input source. The mapper then analyzes the input pairs and emits zero or more new key-value pairs.  K x V -&gt; (L x W)*  (k, v) -&gt; [(l*1*, w*1*), ..., (l*n*, w*n*)]  **Combine Phase**  In the combine phase, multiple key-value pairs with the same key are collected and combined to an intermediate result before being sent to the reducers. **Combine phase is also optional in Hazelcast, but is highly recommended to lower the traffic.**  In terms of the word count example, this can be explained using the sentences \&quot;Saturn is a planet but the Earth is a planet, too\&quot;. As shown above, we would send two key-value pairs (planet, 1). The registered combiner now collects those two pairs and combines them into an intermediate result of (planet, 2). Instead of two key-value pairs sent through the wire, there is now only one for the key \&quot;planet\&quot;.  The pseudo code for a combiner is similar to the reducer.  ```text combine( word:String, counts:List[Int] ):Void -&gt;   emit( word, sum( counts ) ) ```  **Grouping / Shuffling Phase**  The grouping or shuffling phase only exists virtually in Hazelcast since it is not a real phase; emitted key-value pairs with the same key are always transferred to the same reducer in the same job. They are grouped together, which is equivalent to the shuffling phase.  **Reducing Phase**  In the reducing phase, the collected intermediate key-value pairs are reduced by their keys to build the final by-key result. This value can be a sum of all the emitted values of the same key, an average value, or something completely different, depending on the use case.  Here is a reduced representation of this phase.  L x W\* -&gt; X*  (l, [w*1*, ..., w*n*]) -&gt; [x*1*, ..., x*n*]  **Producing the Final Result**  This is not a real MapReduce phase, but it is the final step in Hazelcast after all reducers are notified that reducing has finished. The original job initiator then requests all reduced results and builds the final result.   "

The Hazelcast API for MapReduce operations consists of a fluent DSL-like configuration syntax to build and submit jobs. `JobTracker` is the basic entry point to all MapReduce operations and is retrieved from `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance` by calling `getJobTracker` and supplying the name of the required `JobTracker` configuration. The configuration for `JobTracker`s will be discussed later; for now we focus on the API itself. In addition, the complete submission part of the API is built to support a fully reactive way of programming.  To give an easy introduction to people used to Hadoop, we created the class names to be as familiar as possible to their counterparts on Hadoop. That means while most users will recognize a lot of similar sounding classes, the way to configure the jobs is more fluent due to the DSL-like styled API.  While building the example, we will go through as many options as possible, e.g., we will create a specialized `JobTracker` configuration (at the end). Special `JobTracker` configuration is not required, because for all other Hazelcast features you can use \&quot;default\&quot; as the configuration name. However, special configurations offer better options to predict behavior of the framework execution.  The full example is available &lt;a href=\&quot;http://github.com/noctarius/hz-map-reduce\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as a ready to run Maven project.  "

    title: "Creating a Job",
    body: "#### Creating a Job  As mentioned in [Retrieving a JobTracker Instance](#retrieving-a-jobtracker-instance), you create a Job using the retrieved `JobTracker` instance. A Job defines exactly one configuration of a MapReduce task. Mapper, combiner and reducers will be defined per job. However, since the Job instance is only a configuration, it can be submitted multiple times, regardless of whether executions happen in parallel or one after the other.  A submitted job is always identified using a unique combination of the `JobTracker`'s name and a jobId generated on submit-time. The way to retrieve the jobId will be shown in one of the later sections.  To create a Job, a second class `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.KeyValueSource` is necessary. We will have a deeper look at the `KeyValueSource` class in the next section. `KeyValueSource` is used to wrap any kind of data or data structure into a well defined set of key-value pairs.  The example code below is a direct follow up to the example in [Retrieving a JobTracker Instance](#retrieving-a-jobTracker-instance), and it reuses the already created HazelcastInstance and `JobTracker` instances.  The example starts by retrieving an instance of our data map, and then it creates the Job instance. Implementations used to configure the Job will be discussed while walking further through the API documentation.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Since the Job class is highly dependent upon generics to support type safety, the generics change over time and may not be assignment compatible to old variable types. To make use of the full potential of the fluent API, we recommend you use fluent method chaining as shown in this example to prevent the need for too many variables.*  ```java IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;articles\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); Job&lt;String, String&gt; job = jobTracker.newJob( source );  ICompletableFuture&lt;Map&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; future = job     .mapper( new TokenizerMapper() )     .combiner( new WordCountCombinerFactory() )     .reducer( new WordCountReducerFactory() )     .submit();  // Attach a callback listener future.andThen( buildCallback() );  // Wait and retrieve the result Map&lt;String, Long&gt; result = future.get(); ```  As seen above, we create the Job instance and define a mapper, combiner, and reducer. Then we submit the request to the cluster. The `submit` method returns an ICompletableFuture that can be used to attach our callbacks or to wait for the result to be processed in a blocking fashion.  There are more options available for job configurations, such as defining a general chunk size or on what keys the operation will operate.

    title: "Creating Key-Value Input Sources with KeyValueSource",
    body: "#### Creating Key-Value Input Sources with KeyValueSource  `KeyValueSource` can either wrap Hazelcast data structures (like IMap, MultiMap, IList, ISet) into key-value pair input sources, or build your own custom key-value input source. The latter option makes it possible to feed Hazelcast MapReduce with all kinds of data, such as just-in-time downloaded web page contents or data files. People familiar with Hadoop will recognize similarities with the Input class.  You can imagine a `KeyValueSource` as a bigger `java.util.Iterator` implementation. Whereas most methods must be implemented, implementing the `getAllKeys` method is optional. If implementation is able to gather all keys upfront, it should be implemented and `isAllKeysSupported` must return `true`. That way, Job configured KeyPredicates are able to evaluate keys upfront before sending them to the cluster. Otherwise they are serialized and transferred as well, to be evaluated at execution time.  As shown in the example above, the abstract `KeyValueSource` class provides a number of static methods to easily wrap Hazelcast data structures into `KeyValueSource` implementations already provided by Hazelcast. The data structures' generics are inherited by the resulting `KeyValueSource` instance. For data structures like IList or ISet, the key type is always String. While mapping, the key is the data structure's name, whereas the value type and value itself are inherited from the IList or ISet itself.  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.IMap IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;my-map\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); ```  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.MultiMap MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; multiMap = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( \&quot;my-multimap\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMultiMap( multiMap ); ```  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.IList IList&lt;String&gt; list = hazelcastInstance.getList( \&quot;my-list\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromList( list ); ```  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.ISet ISet&lt;String&gt; set = hazelcastInstance.getSet( \&quot;my-set\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromSet( set ); ```  **PartitionIdAware**  The `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.PartitionIdAware` interface can be implemented by the `KeyValueSource` implementation if the underlying data set is aware of the Hazelcast partitioning schema (as it is for all internal data structures). If this interface is implemented, the same `KeyValueSource` instance is reused multiple times for all partitions on the cluster member. As a consequence, the `close` and `open` methods are also executed multiple times but once per partitionId.  "

    title: "Implementing Mapping Logic with Mapper",
    body: "#### Implementing Mapping Logic with Mapper  Using the `Mapper` interface, you will implement the mapping logic. Mappers can transform, split, calculate, and aggregate data from data sources. In Hazelcast you can also integrate data from more than the KeyValueSource data source by implementing `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceAware` and requesting additional maps, multimaps, list, and/or sets.  The mappers `map` function is called once per available entry in the data structure. If you work on distributed data structures that operate in a partition-based fashion, multiple mappers work in parallel on the different cluster members on the members' assigned partitions. Mappers then prepare and maybe transform the input key-value pair and emit zero or more key-value pairs for the reducing phase.  For our word count example, we retrieve an input document (a text document) and we transform it by splitting the text into the available words. After that, as discussed in the [pseudo code](#mapreduce-workflow-example), we emit every single word with a key-value pair with the word as the key and 1 as the value.  A common implementation of that `Mapper` might look like the following example:  ```java public class TokenizerMapper implements Mapper&lt;String, String, String, Long&gt; {   private static final Long ONE = Long.valueOf( 1L );    @Override   public void map(String key, String document, Context&lt;String, Long&gt; context) {     StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer( document.toLowerCase() );     while ( tokenizer.hasMoreTokens() ) {       context.emit( tokenizer.nextToken(), ONE );     }   } } ```  This code splits the mapped texts into their tokens, iterates over the tokenizer as long as there are more tokens, and emits a pair per word. Note that we're not yet collecting multiple occurrences of the same word, we just fire every word on its own.  **LifecycleMapper / LifecycleMapperAdapter**  The LifecycleMapper interface or its adapter class LifecycleMapperAdapter can be used to make the Mapper implementation lifecycle aware. That means it will be notified when mapping of a partition or set of data begins and when the last entry was mapped.  Only special algorithms might need those additional lifecycle events to prepare, clean up, or emit additional values.  "

    title: "Minimizing Cluster Traffic with Combiner",
    body: "#### Minimizing Cluster Traffic with Combiner  As stated in the introduction, a Combiner is used to minimize traffic between the different cluster members when transmitting mapped values from mappers to the reducers. It does this by aggregating multiple values for the same emitted key. This is a fully optional operation, but using it is highly recommended.  Combiners can be seen as an intermediate reducer. The calculated value is always assigned back to the key for which the combiner initially was created. Since combiners are created per emitted key, the Combiner implementation itself is not defined in the jobs configuration; instead, a CombinerFactory that is able to create the expected Combiner instance is created.  Because Hazelcast MapReduce is executing the mapping and reducing phases in parallel, the Combiner implementation must be able to deal with chunked data. Therefore, you must reset its internal state whenever you call `finalizeChunk`. Calling the `finalizeChunk` method creates a chunk of intermediate data to be grouped (shuffled) and sent to the reducers.  Combiners can override `beginCombine` and `finalizeCombine` to perform preparation or cleanup work.  For our word count example, we are going to have a simple CombinerFactory and Combiner implementation similar to the following example.  ```java public class WordCountCombinerFactory     implements CombinerFactory&lt;String, Long, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Combiner&lt;Long, Long&gt; newCombiner( String key ) {     return new WordCountCombiner();   }    private class WordCountCombiner extends Combiner&lt;Long, Long&gt; {     private long sum = 0;      @Override     public void combine( Long value ) {       sum++;     }      @Override     public Long finalizeChunk() {       return sum;     }              @Override     public void reset() {       sum = 0;     }   } } ```  The Combiner must be able to return its current value as a chunk and reset the internal state by setting `sum` back to 0. Since combiners are always called from a single thread, no synchronization or volatility of the variables is necessary.  "

    body: "#### Doing Algorithm Work with Reducer  Reducers do the last bit of algorithm work. This can be aggregating values, calculating averages, or any other work that is expected from the algorithm.  Since values arrive in chunks, the `reduce` method is called multiple times for every emitted value of the creation key. This also can happen multiple times per chunk if no Combiner implementation was configured for a job configuration.  Unlike combiners, a reducer's `finalizeReduce` method is only called once per reducer (which means once per key). Therefore, a reducer does not need to reset its internal state at any time.  Reducers can override `beginReduce` to perform preparation work.  For our word count example, the implementation will look similar to the following code example.  ```java public class WordCountReducerFactory implements ReducerFactory&lt;String, Long, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Reducer&lt;Long, Long&gt; newReducer( String key ) {     return new WordCountReducer();   }    private class WordCountReducer extends Reducer&lt;Long, Long&gt; {     private volatile long sum = 0;      @Override     public void reduce( Long value ) {       sum += value.longValue();     }      @Override     public Long finalizeReduce() {       return sum;     }   } } ```  "

As of Hazelcast version 3.3.3 the guarantee for memory visibility on the new thread is ensured by the framework. This means the previous requirement for making fields volatile is dropped.  "

Only special use cases are likely to use collators.  For an imaginary use case, we might want to know how many words were all over in the documents we analyzed. For this case, a Collator implementation can be given to the `submit` method of the Job instance.  A collator would look like the following snippet:  ```java public class WordCountCollator implements Collator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Long collate( Iterable&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; values ) {     long sum = 0;      for ( Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt; entry : values ) {       sum += entry.getValue().longValue();     }     return sum;   } } ```  The definition of the input type is a bit strange, but because Combiner and Reducer implementations are optional, the input type heavily depends on the state of the data. As stated above, collators are non-typical use cases and the generics of the framework always help in finding the correct signature.  "

Every `JobTracker` is capable of running multiple MapReduce jobs at once; one configuration is meant as a shared resource for all jobs created by the same `JobTracker`. The configuration gives full control over the expected load behavior and thread counts to be used.  The following snippet shows a typical `JobTracker` configuration. The configuration properties are discussed below the example.  ```xml &lt;jobtracker name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;   &lt;max-thread-size&gt;0&lt;/max-thread-size&gt;   &lt;!-- Queue size 0 means number of partitions * 2 --&gt;   &lt;queue-size&gt;0&lt;/queue-size&gt;   &lt;retry-count&gt;0&lt;/retry-count&gt;   &lt;chunk-size&gt;1000&lt;/chunk-size&gt;   &lt;communicate-stats&gt;true&lt;/communicate-stats&gt;   &lt;topology-changed-strategy&gt;CANCEL_RUNNING_OPERATION&lt;/topology-changed-strategy&gt; &lt;/jobtracker&gt; ```  - **max-thread-size:** Maximum thread pool size of the JobTracker. - **queue-size:** Maximum number of tasks that are able to wait to be processed. A value of 0 means an unbounded queue. Very low numbers can prevent successful execution since the job might not be correctly scheduled or intermediate chunks might be lost. - **retry-count:** Currently not used. Reserved for later use where the framework will automatically try to restart/retry operations from an available save point. - **chunk-size:** Number of emitted values before a chunk is sent to the reducers. If your emitted values are big or you want to better balance your work, you might want to change this to a lower or higher value. A value of 0 means immediate transmission, but remember that low values mean higher traffic costs. A very high value might cause an OutOfMemoryError to occur if the emitted values do not fit into heap memory before being sent to the reducers. To prevent this, you might want to use a combiner to pre-reduce values on mapping members. - **communicate-stats:** Specifies whether the statistics (for example, statistics about processed entries) are transmitted to the job emitter. This can show progress to a user inside of an UI system, but it produces additional traffic. If not needed, you might want to deactivate this. - **topology-changed-strategy:** Specifies how the MapReduce framework reacts on topology changes while executing a job. Currently, only CANCEL_RUNNING_OPERATION is fully supported, which throws an exception to the job emitter (will throw a `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.TopologyChangedException`).   "

    body: "#### Member Interoperation Example  To understand the following technical internals, we first have a short look at what happens in terms of an example workflow.  As a simple example, think of an `IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;` and emitted keys having the same types. Imagine you have a cluster with three members, and you initiate the MapReduce job on the first member. After you requested the JobTracker from your running/connected Hazelcast, we submit the task and retrieve the ICompletableFuture, which gives us a chance to wait for the result to be calculated or to add a callback (and being more reactive).  The example expects that the chunk size is 0 or 1, so an emitted value is directly sent to the reducers. Internally, the job is prepared, started, and executed on all members as shown below. The first member acts as the job owner (job emitter).  ```plain Member1 starts MapReduce job Member1 emits key=Foo, value=1 Member1 does PartitionService::getKeyOwner(Foo) =&gt; results in Member3  Member2 emits key=Foo, value=14 Member2 asks jobOwner (Member1) for keyOwner of Foo =&gt; results in Member3  Member1 sends chunk for key=Foo to Member3  Member3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer,       if not creates one for key=Foo Member3 processes chunk for key=Foo  Member2 sends chunk for key=Foo to Member3  Member3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer and uses       the previous one Member3 processes chunk for key=Foo  Member1 send LastChunk information to Member3 because processing local values finished  Member2 emits key=Foo, value=27 Member2 has cached keyOwner of Foo =&gt; results in Member3 Member2 sends chunk for key=Foo to Member3  Member3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer and uses       the previous one Member3 processes chunk for key=Foo  Member2 send LastChunk information to Member3 because processing local values finished  Member3 finishes reducing for key=Foo  Member1 registers its local partitions are processed Member2 registers its local partitions are processed  Member1 sees all partitions processed and requests reducing from all members  Member1 merges all reduced results together in a final structure and returns it ```  The flow is quite complex but extremely powerful since everything is executed in parallel. Reducers do not wait until all values are emitted, but they immediately begin to reduce (when the first chunk for an emitted key arrives).  "

    title: "MapReduce Job Walk-Through",
    body: "#### MapReduce Job Walk-Through  Now to the technical walk-through: A MapReduce Job is always retrieved from a named `JobTracker`, which is implemented in `NodeJobTracker` (extends `AbstractJobTracker`) and is configured using the configuration DSL. All of the internal implementation is completely ICompletableFuture-driven and mostly non-blocking in design.  On submit, the Job creates a unique UUID which afterwards acts as a jobId and is combined with the JobTracker's name to be uniquely identifiable inside the cluster. Then, the preparation is sent around the cluster and every member prepares its execution by creating a JobSupervisor, MapCombineTask, and ReducerTask. The job-emitting JobSupervisor gains special capabilities to synchronize and control JobSupervisors on other members for the same job.  If preparation is finished on all members, the job itself is started by executing a StartProcessingJobOperation on every member. This initiates a MappingPhase implementation (defaults to KeyValueSourceMappingPhase) and starts the actual mapping on the members.  The mapping process is currently a single threaded operation per member, but will be extended to run in parallel on multiple partitions (configurable per Job) in future versions. The Mapper is now called on every available value on the partition and eventually emits values. For every emitted value, either a configured CombinerFactory is called to create a Combiner or a cached one is used (or the default CollectingCombinerFactory is used to create Combiners). When the chunk limit is reached on a member, a IntermediateChunkNotification is prepared by collecting emitted keys to their corresponding members. This is either done by asking the job owner to assign members or by an already cached assignment. In later versions, a PartitionStrategy might also be configurable.  The IntermediateChunkNotification is then sent to the reducers (containing only values for this member) and is offered to the ReducerTask. On every offer, the ReducerTask checks if it is already running and if not, it submits itself to the configured ExecutorService (from the JobTracker configuration).  If reducer queue runs out of work, the ReducerTask is removed from the ExecutorService to not block threads but eventually will be resubmitted on next chunk of work.  On every phase, the partition state is changed to keep track of the currently running operations. A JobPartitionState can be in one of the following states with self-explanatory titles: `[WAITING, MAPPING, REDUCING, PROCESSED, CANCELLED]`. If you have a deeper interest of these states, look at the Javadoc.  - Member asks for new partition to process: WAITING =&gt; MAPPING - Member emits first chunk to a reducer: MAPPING =&gt; REDUCING - All members signal that they finished mapping phase and reducing is finished, too: REDUCING =&gt; PROCESSED  Eventually, all JobPartitionStates reach the state of PROCESSED. Then, the job emitter's JobSupervisor asks all members for their reduced results and executes a potentially offered Collator. With this Collator, the overall result is calculated before it removes itself from the JobTracker, doing some final cleanup and returning the result to the requester (using the internal TrackableJobFuture).  If a job is cancelled while execution, all partitions are immediately set to the CANCELLED state and a CancelJobSupervisorOperation is executed on all members to kill the running processes.  While the operation is running in addition to the default operations, some more operations like ProcessStatsUpdateOperation (updates processed records statistics) or NotifyRemoteExceptionOperation (notifies the members that the sending member encountered an unrecoverable situation and the Job needs to be cancelled, e.g., NullPointerException inside of a Mapper, are executed against the job owner to keep track of the process.

The MapReduce framework provided the distributed computing model and it was used to back the old Aggregations system. Unfortunately the implementation didn't live up to the expectations and adoption wasn't high, so it never got out of Beta status. Apart from that the current shift in development away from M/R-like processing to a more near-realtime, streaming approach left us with the decision to deprecate and finally remove the MapReduce framework from Hazelcast IMDG. With that said, we want to introduce the successors and replacements; Fast Aggregations on top of Query infrastructure and the Hazelcast Jet distributed computing platform.  "

We realized that we don't need so much power when we simply want to find out a simple metric such as the number of entries matching a predicate. Therefore, the built-in aggregations were rebuilt on top of the existing Query infrastructure (count, sum, min, max, mean, variance) which automatically leverages any matching query index. The aggregations are computed in tho phases:  - 1st phase: on each member (scatter) - 2nd phase: one member aggregates responses from members (gather)  It is not as flexible as a full-blown M/R system due to the 2nd phase being single-member, and the input can be massive in some use cases. The member doing the 2nd step needs enough capacity to hold all intermediate results from all members from the 1st step, but in practice it is sufficient for many aggregation tasks like \&quot;find average\&quot; or \&quot;find highest\&quot; and other common examples.  The benefits are:  - Improved performance - Simplified API  - Utilization of existing indexes   You can refer to [Fast Aggregations](#fast-aggregations) for examples.

    body: "#### Distributed Computation with Jet  Hazelcast Jet is the new distributed computing framework build on top of Hazelcast IMDG. It uses directed acyclic graphs (DAG) to model relationships between individual steps in the data processing pipeline.  Conceptually speaking, the MapReduce model simply states that distributed computation on a large dataset can be boiled down to two kinds of computation steps - a map step and a reduce step. One pair of map and reduce does one level of aggregation over data. Complex computations typically require multiple such steps. Multiple M/R-steps essentially form a DAG of operations, so that a DAG execution model boils down to a generalization of the MapReduce model. Therefore it is always possible to rewrite a MapReduce application to Hazelcast Jet DAG or \&quot;pipeline of tasks\&quot; without conceptual changes.  Benefits:  - M/R steps are completely isolated (by definition). With the whole computation modeled as a DAG, the Jet scheduler can optimize the operation pipeline - Hazelcast Jet provides a convenient high-level API (distributed j.u.stream). The code stays compact but also offers a more concrete API to leverage the full power of DAGs.   "

    title: "Moving MapReduce Tasks to Hazelcast Jet",
    body: "##### Moving MapReduce Tasks to Hazelcast Jet   We'll use the example of the \&quot;word count\&quot; application which summarizes a set of documents into a mapping from each word to the total number of its occurrences in the documents. This involves both a mapping stage where one document is transformed into a stream of words and a reducing stage that performs a COUNT DISTINCT operation on the stream and populates a Hazelcast IMap with the results.  This is the word count code in MapReduce (also available on [hazlcast-jet-code-samples](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-code-samples/blob/master/core/mapreduce-migration/src/main/java/WordCountCoreApi.java)):  ```java JobTracker t = hz.getJobTracker(\&quot;word-count\&quot;); IMap&lt;Long, String&gt; documents = hz.getMap(\&quot;documents\&quot;); LongSumAggregation&lt;String, String&gt; aggr = new LongSumAggregation&lt;&gt;(); Map&lt;String, Long&gt; counts =         t.newJob(KeyValueSource.fromMap(documents))          .mapper((Long x, String document, Context&lt;String, Long&gt; ctx) -&gt;                  Stream.of(document.toLowerCase().split(\&quot;\\W+\&quot;))                        .filter(w -&gt; !w.isEmpty())                        .forEach(w -&gt; ctx.emit(w, 1L)))          .combiner(aggr.getCombinerFactory())          .reducer(aggr.getReducerFactory())          .submit()          .get(); ```  Jet's Core API is strictly lower-level than MapReduce's because it can be used to build the entire infrastructure that can drive MapReduce's mapper, combiner, and reducer, fully preserving the semantics of the MapReduce job. However, this approach to migrating your code to Jet is not a good option because the MapReduce API enforces a quite suboptimal computation model. The simplest approach is implementing the job in terms of Jet's java.util.stream support (Jet JUS for short):  ```java IStreamMap&lt;String, String&gt; documents = jet.getMap(\&quot;documents\&quot;); IMap&lt;String, Long&gt; counts = documents         .stream()         .flatMap(m -&gt; Stream.of(m.getValue().toLowerCase().split(\&quot;\\W+\&quot;))                             .filter(w -&gt; !w.isEmpty()))         .collect(DistributedCollectors.toIMap(w -&gt; w, w -&gt; 1L, (left, right) -&gt; left + right)); ```  This can be taken as a general template to express a MapReduce job in terms of Jet JUS: the logic of the mapper is inside flatMap and the logic of both the combiner and the reducer is inside collect. Jet will automatically apply the optimization where the data stream is first \&quot;combined\&quot; locally on each member, then the partial results \&quot;reduced\&quot; in the final step, after sending across the network.  Keep in mind that MapReduce and java.util.stream use the same terminology, but with quite different meaning: in JUS the final step is called \&quot;combine\&quot; (MapReduce calls it \&quot;reduce\&quot;) and the middle step is called \&quot;reduce\&quot; (MapReduce calls this one \&quot;combine\&quot;). MapReduce's \&quot;combine\&quot; collapses the stream in fixed-size batches, whereas in Jet JUS \&quot;reduce\&quot; collapses the complete local dataset and sends just a single item per distinct key to the final step. In Jet JUS, the final \&quot;combine\&quot; step combines just one partial result per member into the total result, whereas in MR the final step \&quot;reduces\&quot; all the one-per-batch items to the final result. Therefore, in Jet there are only O(distinct-key-count) items sent over the network whereas in MapReduce it is still O(total-item-count) with just a linear scaling factor equal to the configured batch size.  A complete example of the word count done with the Streams API can be found in the hazelcast-jet-code-samples  repository, located in the \&quot;java.util.stream/wordcount-j.u.s\&quot; module in the file WordCount.java. A minor difference is that the code on GitHub stores the documents line by line, with the effect of a finer-grained distribution across the cluster.  To better understand how the JUS pipeline is executed by Jet, take a look at the file WordCount.java in the \&quot;core/wordcount\&quot; module, which builds the same DAG as the Jet JUS implementation, but using the Jet Core API. Here is a somewhat simplified DAG from this sample:  ```java DAG dag = new DAG(); Vertex source = dag.newVertex(\&quot;source\&quot;, Processors.readMap(\&quot;documents\&quot;))                    .localParallelism(1); Vertex map = dag.newVertex(\&quot;map\&quot;, Processors.flatMap(            (String document) -&gt; traverseArray(document.split(\&quot;\\W+\&quot;)))); Vertex reduce = dag.newVertex(\&quot;reduce\&quot;, Processors.groupAndAccumulate(            () -&gt; 0L, (count, x) -&gt; count + 1)); Vertex combine = dag.newVertex(\&quot;combine\&quot;, Processors.groupAndAccumulate(            Entry::getKey,            () -&gt; 0L,            (Long count, Entry&lt;String, Long&gt; wordAndCount) -&gt;                      count + wordAndCount.getValue()) ); Vertex sink = dag.newVertex(\&quot;sink\&quot;, writeMap(\&quot;counts\&quot;));   dag.edge(between(source, map))    .edge(between(map, reduce).partitioned(wholeItem(), HASH_CODE))    .edge(between(reduce, combine).partitioned(entryKey()).distributed())    .edge(between(combine, sink)); ```  It is a simple cascade of vertices: source -&gt; map -&gt; reduce -&gt; combine -&gt; sink and matches quite closely the workflow of a MapReduce job. On each member, a distinct slice of data (IMap partitions stored locally) is ingested by the source vertex and sent to map on the local member. The output of map are words and they travel over a partitioned edge to reduce. Note that, as opposed to MapReduce, a single instance of a processor doesn't count occurrences of just one word, but is responsible for entire partitions. There are only as many processors as configured by the localParallelism property. This is one of several examples where Jet's DAG exposes performance-critical attributes of the computation to the user.  Another example of this can be seen in arguments passed to partitioned(wholeItem(), HASH_CODE). The user has precise control over the partitioning key as well as the algorithm used to map the key to a partition ID. In this case we use the whole item (the word) as the key and apply the fast HASH_CODE strategy, which derives the partition ID from the object's hashCode().  The reduce -&gt; combine edge is both partitioned and distributed. Whereas each cluster member has its own reduce processor for any given word, there is only one combine processor in the entire cluster for a given word. This is where network traffic happens: reduce sends its local results for a word to that one combine processor in the cluster. Note that here we didn't specify HASH_CODE: it is not guaranteed to be safe on a distributed edge because on the target member the hashcode can come out differently. For many value classes (like String and Integer) it is guaranteed to work, though, because their hashCode  explicitly specifies the function used. By default Jet applies the slower but safer Hazelcast strategy: 1. serialize, 2. compute the MurmurHash3 of the resulting blob. It is up to the user to ensure that the faster strategy is safe, or to provide a custom strategy.  In the above example we can see many out-of-the-box processors being used:  - readMap to ingest the data from an IMap - flatMap to perform a flat-map operation on incoming items (closely corresponds to MapReduce's mapper) - groupAndAccumulate to perform the reduction and combining  There are some more in the Processors class. For even more flexibility we'll now show how you can implement a processor on your own (also available in the Code Samples repository):  ```java public class MapReduce {       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {         Jet.newJetInstance();         JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetInstance();         try {             DAG dag = new DAG();             Vertex source = dag.newVertex(\&quot;source\&quot;, readMap(\&quot;sourceMap\&quot;));             Vertex map = dag.newVertex(\&quot;map\&quot;, MapP::new);             Vertex reduce = dag.newVertex(\&quot;reduce\&quot;, ReduceP::new);             Vertex combine = dag.newVertex(\&quot;combine\&quot;, CombineP::new);             Vertex sink = dag.newVertex(\&quot;sink\&quot;, writeMap(\&quot;sinkMap\&quot;));             dag.edge(between(source, map))                .edge(between(map, reduce).partitioned(wholeItem(), HASH_CODE))                .edge(between(reduce, combine).partitioned(entryKey()).distributed())                .edge(between(combine, sink.localParallelism(1)));             jet.newJob(dag).execute().get();         } finally {             Jet.shutdownAll();         }     }       private static class MapP extends AbstractProcessor {         private final FlatMapper&lt;Entry&lt;Long, String&gt;, String&gt; flatMapper = flatMapper(                 (Entry&lt;Long, String&gt; e) -&gt; new WordTraverser(e.getValue())         );           @Override         protected boolean tryProcess0(@Nonnull Object item) {             return flatMapper.tryProcess((Entry&lt;Long, String&gt;) item);         }     }       private static class WordTraverser implements Traverser&lt;String&gt; {           private final StringTokenizer tokenizer;           WordTraverser(String document) {             this.tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(document.toLowerCase());         }           @Override         public String next() {             return tokenizer.hasMoreTokens() ? tokenizer.nextToken() : null;         }     }       private static class ReduceP extends AbstractProcessor {         private final Map&lt;String, Long&gt; wordToCount = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();         private final Traverser&lt;Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; resultTraverser =                 lazy(() -&gt; traverseIterable(wordToCount.entrySet()));           @Override         protected boolean tryProcess0(@Nonnull Object item) {             wordToCount.compute((String) item, (x, count) -&gt; 1 + (count != null ? count : 0L));             return true;         }           @Override         public boolean complete() {             return emitCooperatively(resultTraverser);         }     }       private static class CombineP extends AbstractProcessor {         private final Map&lt;String, Long&gt; wordToCount = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();         private final Traverser&lt;Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; resultTraverser =                 lazy(() -&gt; traverseIterable(wordToCount.entrySet()));           @Override         protected boolean tryProcess0(@Nonnull Object item) {             final Entry&lt;String, Long&gt; e = (Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;) item;             wordToCount.compute(e.getKey(),                     (x, count) -&gt; e.getValue() + (count != null ? count : 0L));             return true;         }           @Override         public boolean complete() {             return emitCooperatively(resultTraverser);         }     } } ```  One of the challenges of implementing a custom Processor is cooperativeness: it must back off as soon as there is no more room in the output buffer (the outbox). This example shows how to make use of another line of convenience provided at this lower level, which takes care of almost all the mechanics involved. One gotcha is that a simple for-loop must be converted to a stateful iterator-style object, like WordTraverser in the above code. To make this conversion as painless as possible we chose to not require a Java Iterator, but defined our own Traverser interface with just a single method to implement. This means that Traverser is a functional interface and can often be implemented with a one-liner lambda.  "

    title: "Jet Compared with New Aggregations",
    body: "#### Jet Compared with New Aggregations  Hazelcast has native support for aggregation operations on the contents of its distributed data structures. They operate on the assumption that the aggregating function is commutative and associative, which allows the two-tiered approach where first the local data is aggregated, then all the local subresults sent to one member, where they are combined and returned to the user. This approach works quite well as long as the result is of manageable size. Many interesting aggregations produce an O(1) result and for those, the native aggregations are a good match.  The main area where native aggregations may not be sufficient are operations that group the data by key and produce results of size O(keyCount). The architecture of Hazelcast aggregations is not well adapted to this use case, although it will still work even for moderately-sized results (up to 100 MB, as a ballpark figure). Beyond these numbers, and whenever something more than a single aggregation step is needed, Jet becomes the preferred choice. In the mentioned use case Jet helps because it doesn't send entire hashtables in serialized form and materialize all the results on the user's machine, but rather streams the key-value pairs directly into a target IMap. Since it is a distributed structure, it doesn't focus its load on a single member.  Jet's DAG paradigm offers much more than the basic map-reduce-combine cascade. Among other setups it can compose several such cascades and also perform co-grouping, joining, and many other operations in complex combinations. "

Apart from the fact we transformed the input value of type `int` (or Integer) to a string, we can see that the generic information of the resulting `Supplier` has changed as well. This indicates that we now have an aggregation working on string values.  "

    body: "##### Implementing Supplier with Special Requirements  You might prefer or need to implement your `Supplier` based on special requirements. This is a very basic task. The `Supplier` abstract class has just one method: the `apply` method. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Due to a limitation of the Java Lambda API, you cannot implement abstract classes using Lambdas. Instead it is recommended that you create a standard named class.*   ```java class MyCustomSupplier extends Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; {   public String apply( Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry ) {     Integer value = entry.getValue();     if (value == null) {       return null;     }     return value % 4 == 0 ? String.valueOf( value ) : null;   } } ```  The `Supplier` `apply` methods are expected to return null whenever the input value should not be mapped to the aggregation process. This can be used, as in the example above, to implement filter rules directly. Implementing filters using the `KeyPredicate` and `Predicate` interfaces might be more convenient.  To use your own `Supplier`, just pass it to the aggregate method or use it in combination with other `Supplier`s.  ```java int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( new MyCustomSupplier(), Aggregations.count() ); ```  ```java Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; supplier =     Supplier.fromKeyPredicate(         lastName -&gt; \&quot;Jones\&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase( lastName ),         new MyCustomSupplier()      ); int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( supplier, Aggregations.count() ); ```  "

There is another way to implicitly configure the underlying used `JobTracker`. If no specific `JobTracker` was passed for the aggregation call, internally one will be created using the following naming specifications:  For `IMap` aggregation calls the naming specification is created as:  - `hz::aggregation-map-` and the concatenated name of the map.  For `MultiMap` it is very similar:  - `hz::aggregation-multimap-` and the concatenated name of the MultiMap.  Knowing the specification of the name, we can configure the `JobTracker` as expected  (as described in [Retrieving a JobTracker Instance](#retrieving-a-jobtracker-instance)) using the naming spec we just learned. For more information on configuration of the  `JobTracker`, please see [Configuring Jobtracker](#configuring-jobtracker).   To finish this section, let's have a quick example for the above naming specs:  ```java IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mymap\&quot; );  // The internal JobTracker name resolves to 'hz::aggregation-map-mymap'  map.aggregate( ... ); ```  ```java MultiMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; multimap = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( \&quot;mymultimap\&quot; );  // The internal JobTracker name resolves to 'hz::aggregation-multimap-mymultimap'  multimap.aggregate( ... ); ```  "

This time, we want to filter based on an office name and we need to do some data joins to achieve this kind of filtering.   **A short tip:** to minimize the data transmission on the aggregation we can use [Data Affinity](#data-affinity) rules to influence the partitioning of data. Be aware that this is an expert feature of Hazelcast.  ```java class OfficeEmployeeFilter implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt;, HazelcastInstanceAware {   private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;   private String office;      // Deserialization Constructor   public OfficeEmployeeFilter() {   }       public OfficeEmployeeFilter( String office ) {     this.office = office;   }      public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) {     this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;   }      public boolean evaluate( String email ) {     MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment = hazelcastInstance         .getMultiMap( \&quot;office-employee\&quot; );      return officeAssignment.containsEntry( office, email );       } } ```  Now we can execute our aggregations. As mentioned before, we currently need to do the grouping on our own by executing multiple aggregations in a row.  ```java Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; avgSalariesPerOffice = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();  IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;salaries\&quot; ); MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment =     hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( \&quot;office-employee\&quot; );  PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor =     (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary();  for ( String office : officeAssignment.keySet() ) {   OfficeEmployeeFilter filter = new OfficeEmployeeFilter( office );   int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( filter, extractor ),                                       Aggregations.integerAvg() );                                          avgSalariesPerOffice.put( office, avgSalary ); } ```  "

Note that a continuous query cache has a default maximum capacity of 10000. If you need a non-evictable cache, you should configure the eviction via `QueryCacheConfig#setEvictionConfig`. * A listener can be added to a continuous query cache using `QueryCache#addEntryListener`. * `IMap` events are reflected in continuous query cache in the same order as they were generated on map entries. Since events are created on entries stored in partitions, ordering of events is maintained based on the ordering within the partition. You can add listeners to capture lost events using `EventLostListener` and you can recover lost events with the method `QueryCache#tryRecover`. Recovery of lost events largely depends on the size of the buffer on Hazelcast members. Default buffer size is 16 per partition; i.e. 16 events per partition can be maintained in the buffer. If the event generation is high, setting the buffer size to a higher number will provide better chances of recovering lost events. You can set buffer size with `QueryCacheConfig#setBufferSize`. You can use the following example code for a recovery case.      ```java                QueryCache queryCache = map.getQueryCache(\&quot;cache-name\&quot;, new SqlPredicate(\&quot;this &gt; 20\&quot;), true);        queryCache.addEntryListener(new EventLostListener() {            @Override            public void eventLost(EventLostEvent event) {                queryCache.tryRecover();            }        }, false);     ```     * You can configure continuous query cache declaratively or programmatically. * You can populate a continuous query cache with only the keys of its entries and retrieve the subsequent values directly via `QueryCache#get` from the underlying `IMap`. This helps to decrease the initial population time when the values are very large. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      "

    body: "## Creating a Transaction Interface  You create a `TransactionContext` object to begin, commit, and rollback a transaction. You can obtain transaction-aware instances of queues, maps, sets, lists, multimaps via `TransactionContext`, work with them, and commit/rollback in one shot. You can see the [TransactionContext source code here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/transaction/TransactionContext.java).  Hazelcast supports two types of transactions: ONE_PHASE and TWO_PHASE. The type of transaction controls what happens when a member crashes while a transaction is committing. The default behavior is TWO_PHASE. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, the transaction type `LOCAL` has been deprecated. Please use `ONE_PHASE` for the Hazelcast releases 3.6 and higher.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  - **ONE_PHASE**: By selecting this transaction type, you execute the transactions with a single phase that is committing the changes. Since a preparing phase does not exist, the conflicts are not detected. When a conflict happens while committing the changes, e.g., due to a member crash, not all the changes are written and this leaves the system in an inconsistent state.  - **TWO_PHASE**: When you select this transaction type, Hazelcast first tries to execute the prepare phase. This phase fails if there are any conflicts. Once the prepare phase is successful, Hazelcast executes the commit phase (writing the changes). Before TWO_PHASE commits, Hazelcast copies the commit log to other members, so in case of a member failure, another member can complete the commit.  ```java import java.util.Queue; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.Transaction;  HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();  TransactionOptions options = new TransactionOptions()     .setTransactionType( TransactionType.ONE_PHASE );      TransactionContext context = hazelcastInstance.newTransactionContext( options ); context.beginTransaction();  TransactionalQueue queue = context.getQueue( \&quot;myqueue\&quot; ); TransactionalMap map = context.getMap( \&quot;mymap\&quot; ); TransactionalSet set = context.getSet( \&quot;myset\&quot; );  try {   Object obj = queue.poll();   //process obj   map.put( \&quot;1\&quot;, \&quot;value1\&quot; );   set.add( \&quot;value\&quot; );   //do other things..   context.commitTransaction(); } catch ( Throwable t ) {   context.rollbackTransaction(); } ```  In a transaction, operations will not be executed immediately. Their changes will be local to the `TransactionContext` until committed. However, they will ensure the changes via locks.   For the above example, when `map.put` is executed, no data will be put in the map but the key will be locked against changes. While committing, operations will be executed, the value will be put to the map, and the key will be unlocked.  The isolation level in Hazelcast Transactions is `READ_COMMITTED` on the level of a single partition. If you are in a transaction, you can read the data in your transaction and the data that is already committed. If you are not in a transaction, you can only read the committed data.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The REPEATABLE_READ isolation level can also be exercised using the method `getForUpdate()` of `TransactionalMap`.*  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The isolation levels might be broken if the objects involved in the transaction span multiple partitions. A reader which is not in a transaction can then temporarily observe partially committed data.*  "

For map/multimap, Hazelcast first acquires the locks for the write operations (put, remove) and holds the differences (what is added/removed/updated) locally for each transaction. When the transaction is set to commit, Hazelcast will release the locks and apply the differences. When rolling back, Hazelcast will release the locks and discard the differences.  `MapStore` and `QueueStore` do not participate in transactions. Hazelcast will suppress exceptions thrown by the store in a transaction. Please refer to the [XA Transactions section](#providing-xa-transactions) for further information.  "

In this case, all the other members are asked to agree that the commit can succeed and once they agree, Hazelcast starts to write the changes.  However, if the member that initiates the commit crashes after it has written to at least one member (but has not completed writing to all other members), your system may be left in an inconsistent state.  On the other hand, if you choose TWO_PHASE as the transaction type, the commit log is again tracked locally but it is copied to another cluster member. Therefore, when a failure happens, e.g., the member initiating the commit crashes, you still have the commit log in another member and that member can complete the commit. However, copying the commit log to another member makes the TWO_PHASE approach slow.  Consequently, it is recommended that you choose ONE_PHASE as the transaction type if you want better performance, and that you choose TWO_PHASE if reliability of your system is more important than the performance.

When you implement the `XAResource` interface, Hazelcast provides XA transactions. You can obtain the `HazelcastXAResource` instance via the `HazelcastInstance getXAResource` method. You can see the [HazelcastXAResource source code here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/transaction/HazelcastXAResource.java).

To show our commitment to this important specification that the Java world was waiting for over a decade, we did not just provide a simple wrapper around our existing APIs; we implemented a caching structure from the ground up to optimize the behavior to the needs of JCache. The Hazelcast JCache implementation is 100% TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) compliant and therefore passes all specification requirements.  In addition to the given specification, we added some features like asynchronous versions of almost all operations to give the user extra power.    This chapter gives a basic understanding of how to configure your application and how to setup Hazelcast to be your JCache provider. It also shows examples of basic JCache usage as well as the additionally offered features that are not part of JSR-107.

CacheEntryListener`.   - `cache-entry-listener#old-value-required`: If set to true, previously assigned values for the affected keys will be sent to the `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener` implementation.

Hazelcast implements a delegating `CachingProvider` that can automatically be configured for either client or member mode and that delegates to the real underlying implementation based on the user's choice.

The delegating `CachingProvider`s fully qualified class name is  ```plain com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCachingProvider ```  To configure the delegating provider at the command line, add the following parameter to the Java startup call, depending on the chosen provider:  ```plain -Dhazelcast.jcache.provider.type=[client|server] ```  By default, the delegating `CachingProvider` is automatically picked up by the JCache SPI and provided as shown above. In cases where multiple `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider` implementations reside on the classpath (like in some Application Server scenarios), you can select a `CachingProvider` by explicitly calling `Caching::getCachingProvider` overloads and providing them using the canonical class name of the provider to be used.

The following are quick descriptions of them:  **`javax.cache.Caching`**:  The access point into the JCache API. It retrieves the general `CachingProvider` backed by any compliant JCache implementation, such as Hazelcast JCache.  **`javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`**:  The SPI that is implemented to bridge between the JCache API and the implementation itself. Hazelcast members and clients use different providers chosen as seen in the [Configuring JCache Provider section](#configuring-jcache-provider) which enable the JCache API to interact with Hazelcast clusters.  When a `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider::getCacheManager` overload is used that takes a `java.lang.ClassLoader` argument, this classloader will be part of the scope of the created `java.cache.Cache` and it is not possible to retrieve it on other members. We advise not to use those overloads, as they are not meant to be used in distributed environments!  **`javax.cache.CacheManager`**:  The `CacheManager` provides the capability to create new and manage existing JCache caches.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *A `javax.cache.Cache` instance created with key and value types in the configuration provides a type checking of those types at retrieval of the cache. For that reason, all non-types retrieval methods like `getCache` throw an exception because types cannot be checked.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  **`javax.cache.configuration.Configuration`**, **`javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration`**:  These two classes are used to configure a cache prior to retrieving it from a `CacheManager`. The `Configuration` interface, therefore, acts as a common super type for all compatible configuration classes such as `MutableConfiguration`.  Hazelcast itself offers a special implementation (`com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig`) of the `Configuration` interface which offers more options on the specific Hazelcast properties that can be set to configure features like synchronous and asynchronous backups counts or selecting the underlying [In Memory Format](#setting-in-memory-format) of the cache. For more information on this configuration class, please see the reference in [JCache Programmatic Configuration section](#jcache-programmatic-configuration).  **`javax.cache.Cache`**:  This interface represents the cache instance itself. It is comparable to `java.util.Map` but offers special operations dedicated to the caching use case. Therefore, for example `javax.cache.Cache::put`, unlike `java.util.Map::put`, does not return the old value previously assigned to the given key.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Bulk operations on the `Cache` interface guarantee atomicity per entry but not over all given keys in the same bulk operations since no transactional behavior is applied over the whole batch process.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

Therefore, these factory implementations have to be serializable.  `Factory` implementations are easy to do, as they follow the default Provider- or Factory-Pattern. The sample class `UserCacheEntryListenerFactory` shown below implements a custom JCache `Factory`.  ```java public class UserCacheEntryListenerFactory     implements Factory&lt;CacheEntryListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;&gt; {    @Override   public CacheEntryListener&lt;Integer, User&gt; create() {     // Just create a new listener instance     return new UserCacheEntryListener();   } } ```  To simplify the process for the users, JCache API offers a set of helper methods collected in `javax.cache. configuration.FactoryBuilder`.

Otherwise, there is currently no way to trigger writing changed entries to the external resource to a user-defined point in time.  If bulk operations throw an exception, `java.util.Collection` has to be cleaned of all successfully written keys so the cache implementation can determine what keys are written and can be applied to the cache state.  The following example performs the following tasks:  - It implements `CacheWriter`. - It overrides the `write` method to write the specified entry to the underlying store. - It overrides the `writeAll` method to write the specified entires to the underlying store. - It overrides the `delete` method to delete the key entry from the store. - It overrides the `deleteAll` method to delete the data and keys from the underlying store for the given collection of keys, if present.  ```java public class UserCacheWriter     implements CacheWriter&lt;Integer, User&gt;, Serializable {    private final UserDao userDao;    public UserCacheWriter( UserDao userDao ) {     // Store the dao instance created externally     this.userDao = userDao;   }    @Override   public void write( Cache.Entry&lt;? extends Integer, ? extends User&gt; entry )       throws CacheWriterException {      // Store the user using the dao     userDao.storeUser( entry.getKey(), entry.getValue() );   }    @Override   public void writeAll( Collection&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;...&gt;&gt; entries )       throws CacheWriterException {      // Retrieve the iterator to clean up the collection from     // written keys in case of an exception     Iterator&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;...&gt;&gt; iterator = entries.iterator();     while ( iterator.hasNext() ) {       // Write entry using dao       write( iterator.next() );       // Remove from collection of keys       iterator.remove();     }   }    @Override   public void delete( Object key ) throws CacheWriterException {     // Test for key type     if ( !( key instanceof Integer ) ) {       throw new CacheWriterException( \&quot;Illegal key type\&quot; );     }     // Remove user using dao     userDao.removeUser( ( Integer ) key );   }    @Override   public void deleteAll( Collection&lt;?&gt; keys ) throws CacheWriterException {     // Retrieve the iterator to clean up the collection from     // written keys in case of an exception     Iterator&lt;?&gt; iterator = keys.iterator();     while ( iterator.hasNext() ) {       // Write entry using dao       delete( iterator.next() );       // Remove from collection of keys       iterator.remove();     }   } } ```  Again, the implementation is pretty straightforward and also as above all exceptions thrown by the external resource, like `java.sql.SQLException` has to be wrapped into a `javax.cache.integration.CacheWriterException`.

In a distributed environment like Hazelcast, you can move the mutating function to the member that owns the key. If the value object is big, it might prevent traffic by sending the object to the mutator and sending it back to the owner to update it.  By default, Hazelcast JCache sends the complete changed value to the backup partition. Again, this can cause a lot of traffic if the object is big. The Hazelcast ICache extension can also prevent this. Further information is available at [Implementing BackupAwareEntryProcessor](#implementing-backupawareentryprocessor).  An arbitrary number of arguments can be passed to the `Cache::invoke` and `Cache::invokeAll` methods. All of those arguments need to be fully serializable because in a distributed environment like Hazelcast, it is very likely that these arguments have to be passed around the cluster.  The following example performs the following tasks.  - It implements `EntryProcessor`. - It overrides the `process` method to process an entry.  ```java public class UserUpdateEntryProcessor     implements EntryProcessor&lt;Integer, User, User&gt; {    @Override   public User process( MutableEntry&lt;Integer, User&gt; entry, Object... arguments )       throws EntryProcessorException {      // Test arguments length     if ( arguments.length &lt; 1 ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException( \&quot;One argument needed: username\&quot; );     }      // Get first argument and test for String type     Object argument = arguments[0];     if ( !( argument instanceof String ) ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException(           \&quot;First argument has wrong type, required java.lang.String\&quot; );     }      // Retrieve the value from the MutableEntry     User user = entry.getValue();      // Retrieve the new username from the first argument     String newUsername = ( String ) arguments[0];      // Set the new username     user.setUsername( newUsername );      // Set the changed user to mark the entry as dirty     entry.setValue( user );      // Return the changed user to return it to the caller     return user;   } } ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *By executing the bulk `Cache::invokeAll` operation, atomicity is only guaranteed for a single cache entry.

Expiry does not have to be a parallel process-- it is only required to be executed on the keys that are requested by `Cache::get` and some other operations. For a full table of expiry please see the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107&lt;/a&gt; point 6.    To configure `CacheEntryListener`, add a `javax.cache.configuration.CacheEntryListenerConfiguration` instance to the JCache configuration class, as seen in the above example configuration. In addition, listeners can be configured to be executed synchronously (blocking the calling thread) or asynchronously (fully running in parallel).  In this example application, the listener is implemented to print event information on the console. That visualizes what is going on in the cache. This application performs the following tasks:  - It implements CacheEntryCreatedListener. - It implements the `onCreated` method to call after an entry is created. - It implements the `onUpdated` method to call after an entry is updated. - It implements the `onRemoved` method to call after an entry is removed. - It implements the `onExpired` method to call after an entry expires. - It implements `printEvents` to print event information on the console.  ```java public class UserCacheEntryListener     implements CacheEntryCreatedListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;,         CacheEntryUpdatedListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;,         CacheEntryRemovedListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;,         CacheEntryExpiredListener&lt;Integer, User&gt; {    @Override   public void onCreated( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    @Override   public void onUpdated( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    @Override   public void onRemoved( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    @Override   public void onExpired( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    private void printEvents( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents ) {     Iterator&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; iterator = cacheEntryEvents.iterator();     while ( iterator.hasNext() ) {       CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt; event = iterator.next();       System.out.println( event.getEventType() );     }   } } ```  "

Expiry timeouts are defined using `javax.cache.expiry.Duration`, which is a pair of `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit`, that describes a time unit and a long, defining the timeout value. The minimum allowed `TimeUnit` is `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`. The long value `durationAmount` must be equal or greater than zero. A value of zero (or `Duration.ZERO`) indicates that the cache entry expires immediately.  By default, JCache delivers a set of predefined expiry strategies in the standard API.  - `AccessedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is updated on accessing the key. - `CreatedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is never updated. - `EternalExpiryPolicy`: Never expires. This is the default behavior, similar to `ExpiryPolicy` being set to null. - `ModifiedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is updated on updating the key. - `TouchedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is updated on accessing or updating the key.

Here is an example of using configuration scope:  ```java CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  // Create Properties instance pointing to a Hazelcast config file Properties properties = new Properties(); // \&quot;scope-hazelcast.xml\&quot; resides in package com.domain.config properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION,     \&quot;classpath:com/domain/config/scoped-hazelcast.xml\&quot; );  URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-cache-manager\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); ```  Here is an example using `HazelcastCachingProvider::propertiesByLocation` helper method:  ```java CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  // Create Properties instance pointing to a Hazelcast config file in root package String configFile = \&quot;classpath:scoped-hazelcast.xml\&quot;; Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider     .propertiesByLocation( configFile );  URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-cache-manager\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); ```  The retrieved `CacheManager` is scoped to use the `HazelcastInstance` that was just created and configured using the given XML configuration file.  Available protocols for config file URL include `classpath` to point to a classpath location, `file` to point to a filesystem location, and `http` and `https` for remote web locations. In addition, everything that does not specify a protocol is recognized as a placeholder that can be configured using a system property.  ```java String configFile = \&quot;my-placeholder\&quot;; Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider     .propertiesByLocation( configFile ); ```  You can set this on the command line:  ```plain -Dmy-placeholder=classpath:my-configs/scoped-hazelcast.xml ```  You should consider the following rules about the Hazelcast instance name when you specify the configuration file location using `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION` (which resolves to `hazelcast.config.location`):  * If you also specified the `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` (which resolves to `hazelcast.instance.name`) property, this property is used as the instance name even though you configured the instance name in the configuration file. * If you do not specify `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` but you configure the instance name in the configuration file using the element `&lt;instance-name&gt;`, this element's value will be used as the instance name. * If you do not specify an instance name via property or in the configuration file, the URL of the configuration file location is used as the instance name.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *No check is performed to prevent creating multiple `CacheManager`s with the same cluster configuration on different configuration files. If the same cluster is referred from different configuration files, multiple cluster members or clients are created.*  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The configuration file location will not be a part of the resulting identity of the `CacheManager`. An attempt to create a `CacheManager` with a different set of properties but an already used name will result in undefined behavior.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

    body: "#### Binding to a Named Instance  You can bind `CacheManager` to an existing and named `HazelcastInstance` instance. If the `instanceName` is specified in `com.hazelcast.config.Config`, it can be used directly by passing it to `CachingProvider` implementation. Otherwise (`instanceName` not set or instance is a client instance) you must get the instance name from the `HazelcastInstance` instance via the `String getName()` method to pass the `CachingProvider` implementation. Please note that `instanceName` is not configurable for the client side `HazelcastInstance` instance and is auto-generated by using group name (if it is specified). In general, `String getName()` method over `HazelcastInstance` is safer and the preferable way to get the name of the instance. Multiple `CacheManager`s created using an equal `java.net.URI` will share the same `HazelcastInstance`.  A named scope is applied nearly the same way as the configuration scope. Pass the instance name using:  - either the property `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` (which resolves to `hazelcast.instance.name`) as a mapping inside a `java.util.Properties` instance to the `CachingProvider#getCacheManager(uri, classLoader, properties)` call. - or use the instance name when specifying the `CacheManager`'s `URI`.  If a valid instance name is provided both as property and as `URI`, then the property value takes precedence and is used to resolve the `HazelcastInstance` the first time a `CacheManager` is created for the given `URI`.  Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with specified name:  ```java Config config = new Config(); config.setInstanceName( \&quot;my-named-hazelcast-instance\&quot; ); // Create a named HazelcastInstance Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );  CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  // Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance Properties properties = new Properties(); properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME,      \&quot;my-named-hazelcast-instance\&quot; );  URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-cache-manager\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); ```  Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with specified name passed as `URI` of the `CacheManager`:  ```java Config config = new Config(); config.setInstanceName( \&quot;my-named-hazelcast-instance\&quot; ); // Create a named HazelcastInstance Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );  CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider(); URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-named-hazelcast-instance\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null); ```  Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with auto-generated name:  ```java Config config = new Config(); // Create a auto-generated named HazelcastInstance HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config ); String instanceName = instance.getName();  CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  // Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance Properties properties = new Properties(); properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME,       instanceName );  URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-cache-manager\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); ```  Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with auto-generated name on client instance:  ```java ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig(); networkConfig.addAddress(\&quot;127.0.0.1\&quot;, \&quot;127.0.0.2\&quot;);  // Create a client side HazelcastInstance HazelcastInstance instance = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig ); String instanceName = instance.getName();  CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  // Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance Properties properties = new Properties(); properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME,       instanceName );  URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-cache-manager\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); ```  Here is an example using `HazelcastCachingProvider::propertiesByInstanceName` method:  ```java Config config = new Config(); config.setInstanceName( \&quot;my-named-hazelcast-instance\&quot; ); // Create a named HazelcastInstance Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );  CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  // Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider     .propertiesByInstanceName( \&quot;my-named-hazelcast-instance\&quot; );  URI cacheManagerName = new URI( \&quot;my-cache-manager\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider     .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The `instanceName` will not be a part of the resulting identity of the `CacheManager`.

This is useful where multiple applications might share the same Hazelcast JCache implementation, e.g., on application or OSGi servers, but are developed by independent teams. To prevent interfering on caches using the same name, every application can use its own namespace when retrieving the `CacheManager`.  Here is an example of using namespacing.  ```java CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();  URI nsApp1 = new URI( \&quot;application-1\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManagerApp1 = cachingProvider.getCacheManager( nsApp1, null );  URI nsApp2 = new URI( \&quot;application-2\&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManagerApp2 = cachingProvider.getCacheManager( nsApp2, null ); ```  That way both applications share the same `HazelcastInstance` instance but not the same caches.

These additional properties include internal storage format, backup counts, eviction policy and quorum reference.  The declarative configuration for ICache is a superset of the previously discussed JCache configuration:  ```xml &lt;cache&gt;   &lt;!-- ... default cache configuration goes here ... --&gt;   &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;/backup-count&gt;   &lt;async-backup-count&gt;1&lt;/async-backup-count&gt;   &lt;in-memory-format&gt;BINARY&lt;/in-memory-format&gt;   &lt;eviction size=\&quot;10000\&quot; max-size-policy=\&quot;ENTRY_COUNT\&quot; eviction-policy=\&quot;LRU\&quot; /&gt;   &lt;partition-lost-listeners&gt;      &lt;partition-lost-listener&gt;CachePartitionLostListenerImpl&lt;/partition-lost-listener&gt;  &lt;/partition-lost-listeners&gt;  &lt;quorum-ref&gt;quorum-name&lt;/quorum-ref&gt;  &lt;disable-per-entry-invalidation-events&gt;true&lt;/disable-per-entry-invalidation-events&gt; &lt;/cache&gt; ```  - `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups. Those backups are executed before the mutating cache operation is finished. The mutating operation is blocked. `backup-count` default value is 1. - `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups. Those backups are executed asynchronously so the mutating operation is not blocked and it will be done immediately. `async-backup-count` default value is 0.   - `in-memory-format`: Internal storage format. For more information, please see the [In Memory Format section](#setting-in-memory-format). Default is `BINARY`. - `eviction`: Defines the used eviction strategies and sizes for the cache. For more information on eviction, please see the [JCache Eviction](#jcache-eviction).   - `size`: Maximum number of records or maximum size in bytes depending on the `max-size-policy` property. Size can be any integer between `0` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Default max-size-policy is `ENTRY_COUNT` and default size is `10.000`.   - `max-size-policy`: Maximum size. If maximum size is reached, the cache is evicted based on the eviction policy. Default max-size-policy is `ENTRY_COUNT` and default size is `10.000`. The following eviction policies are available:     - `ENTRY_COUNT`: Maximum number of cache entries in the cache. **Available on heap based cache record store only.**     - `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: Maximum used native memory size in megabytes per cache for each Hazelcast instance. **Available on High-Density Memory cache record store only.**     - `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: Maximum used native memory size percentage per cache for each Hazelcast instance. **Available on High-Density Memory cache record store only.**     - `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: Minimum free native memory size in megabytes for each Hazelcast instance. **Available on High-Density Memory cache record store only.**     - `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: Minimum free native memory size percentage for each Hazelcast instance. **Available on High-Density Memory cache record store only.**   - `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy that compares values to find the best matching eviction candidate. Default is `LRU`.     - `LRU`: Less Recently Used - finds the best eviction candidate based on the lastAccessTime.     - `LFU`: Less Frequently Used - finds the best eviction candidate based on the number of hits. - `partition-lost-listeners` : Defines listeners for dispatching partition lost events for the cache. For more information, please see the [ICache Partition Lost Listener section](#icache-partition-lost-listener). - `quorum-ref` : Name of quorum configuration that you want this cache to use. - `disable-per-entry-invalidation-events` : Disables invalidation events for each entry; but full-flush invalidation events are still enabled. Full-flush invalidation means the invalidation of events for all entries when `clear` is called. The default value is `false`.  Since `javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration` misses the above additional configuration properties, Hazelcast ICache extension provides an extended configuration class called `com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig`. This class is an implementation of `javax.cache.configuration.CompleteConfiguration` and all the properties shown above can be configured using its corresponding setter methods.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *At the client side, ICache can be configured only programmatically.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

The asynchronous versions of the methods append the phrase `Async` to the method name. The example code below uses the method `putAsync()`.  ```java ICache&lt;Integer, String&gt; unwrappedCache = cache.unwrap( ICache.class ); ICompletableFuture&lt;String&gt; future = unwrappedCache.putAsync( 1, \&quot;value\&quot; ); future.andThen( new ExecutionCallback&lt;String&gt;() {   public void onResponse( String response ) {     System.out.println( \&quot;Previous value: \&quot; + response );   }    public void onFailure( Throwable t ) {     t.printStackTrace();   } } ); ```  Following methods are available in asynchronous versions:   - `get(key)`:   - `getAsync(key)`   - `getAsync(key, expiryPolicy)`  - `put(key, value)`:   - `putAsync(key, value)`   - `putAsync(key, value, expiryPolicy)`  - `putIfAbsent(key, value)`:   - `putIfAbsentAsync(key, value)`   - `putIfAbsentAsync(key, value, expiryPolicy)`  - `getAndPut(key, value)`:   - `getAndPutAsync(key, value)`   - `getAndPutAsync(key, value, expiryPolicy)`  - `remove(key)`:   - `removeAsync(key)`  - `remove(key, value)`:   - `removeAsync(key, value)`  - `getAndRemove(key)`:   - `getAndRemoveAsync(key)`  - `replace(key, value)`:   - `replaceAsync(key, value)`   - `replaceAsync(key, value, expiryPolicy)`  - `replace(key, oldValue, newValue)`:   - `replaceAsync(key, oldValue, newValue)`   - `replaceAsync(key, oldValue, newValue, expiryPolicy)`  - `getAndReplace(key, value)`:   - `getAndReplaceAsync(key, value)`   - `getAndReplaceAsync(key, value, expiryPolicy)`  The methods with a given `javax.cache.expiry.ExpiryPolicy` are further discussed in the [Defining a Custom ExpiryPolicy](#defining-a-custom-expirypolicy).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Asynchronous versions of the methods are not compatible with synchronous events.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

EvictionConfig evictionConfig =      new EvictionConfig(50000,                         MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT,                         new MyEvictionPolicyComparator()); cacheConfig.setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig); ```  **Declarative:**  You can specify the full class name of custom `EvictionPolicyComparator` (`CacheEvictionPolicyComparator` for JCache and its Near Cache) implementation  in the `&lt;eviction&gt;` tag through `comparator-class-name` attribute in Hazelcast configuration XML file.  ```xml &lt;cache name=\&quot;cacheWithCustomEvictionPolicyComparator\&quot;&gt;      &lt;eviction size=\&quot;50000\&quot; max-size-policy=\&quot;ENTRY_COUNT\&quot; comparator-class-name=\&quot;com.mycompany.MyEvictionPolicyComparator\&quot;/&gt;  &lt;/cache&gt; ```  **Declarative for Spring:**  You can specify the full class name of custom `EvictionPolicyComparator` (`CacheEvictionPolicyComparator` for JCache and its Near Cache) implementation  in the `&lt;eviction&gt;` tag through `comparator-class-name` attribute in Hazelcast *Spring* configuration XML file.  ```xml &lt;hz:cache name=\&quot;cacheWithCustomEvictionPolicyComparator\&quot;&gt;     &lt;hz:eviction size=\&quot;50000\&quot; max-size-policy=\&quot;ENTRY_COUNT\&quot; comparator-class-name=\&quot;com.mycompany.MyEvictionPolicyComparator\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/hz:cache&gt; ```  You can specify the custom `EvictionPolicyComparator` (`CacheEvictionPolicyComparator` for JCache and its Near Cache) bean in the `&lt;eviction&gt;` tag  by referencing through `comparator-bean` attribute in Hazelcast *Spring* configuration XML file  ```xml &lt;hz:cache name=\&quot;cacheWithCustomEvictionPolicyComparator\&quot;&gt;     &lt;hz:eviction size=\&quot;50000\&quot; max-size-policy=\&quot;ENTRY_COUNT\&quot; comparator-bean=\&quot;myEvictionPolicyComparatorBean\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/hz:cache&gt; ```  "

    title: "Eviction Algorithm",
    body: "#### Eviction Algorithm  The Hazelcast JCache eviction algorithm is specially designed for the use case of high performance caches and with predictability in mind. The built-in implementations provide an amortized O(1) runtime and therefore provide a highly predictable runtime behavior which does not rely on any kind of background threads to handle the eviction. Therefore, the algorithm takes some assumptions into account to prevent network operations and concurrent accesses.  As an explanation of how the algorithm works, let's examine the following flowchart step by step.  ![Hazelcast JCache Eviction Algorithm](images/EvictionFlowchart.png)  1. A new cache is created. Without any special settings, the eviction is configured to kick in when the **cache** exceeds 10.000 elements and an LRU (Less Recently Used) policy is set up. 2. The user puts in a new entry, e.g., a key-value pair. 3. For every put, the eviction strategy evaluates the current cache size and decides if an eviction is necessary or not. If not, the entry is stored in step 10. 4. If eviction is required, a new sampling is started. The built-in sampler is implemented as an lazy iterator. 5. The sampling algorithm selects a random sample from the underlying data storage. 6. The eviction strategy tests whether the sampled entry is already expired (lazy expiration). If expired, the sampling stops and the entry is removed in step 9. 7. If not yet expired, the entry (eviction candidate) is compared to the last best matching candidate (based on the eviction policy) and the new best matching candidate is remembered. 8. The sampling is repeated 15 times and then the best matching eviction candidate is returned to the eviction strategy. 9. The expired or best matching eviction candidate is removed from the underlying data storage. 10. The new put entry is stored. 11. The put operation returns to the user.  As seen in the flowchart, the general eviction operation is easy. As long as the cache does not reach its maximum capacity, or you execute updates (put/replace), no eviction is executed.  To prevent network operations and concurrent access, as mentioned earlier, the cache size is estimated based on the size of the currently handled partition. Due to the imbalanced partitions, the single partitions might start to evict earlier than the other partitions.  As mentioned in the [Cache Types section](#cache-types), typically two types of caches are found in the production systems. For small caches, referred to as *Reference Caches*, the eviction algorithm has a special set of rules depending on the maximum configured cache size. Please see the [Reference Caches section](#reference-caches) for details. The other type of cache is referred to as an *Active DataSet Cache*, which in most cases makes heavy use of the eviction to keep the most active data set in the memory. Those kinds of caches use a very simple but efficient way to estimate the cluster-wide cache size.  All of the following calculations have a well known set of fixed variables:  - `GlobalCapacity`: User defined maximum cache size (cluster-wide). - `PartitionCount`: Number of partitions in the cluster (defaults to 271). - `BalancedPartitionSize`: Number of elements in a balanced partition state, `BalancedPartitionSize := GlobalCapacity / PartitionCount`. - `Deviation`: An approximated standard deviation (tests proofed it to be pretty near), `Deviation := sqrt(BalancedPartitionSize)`.

    title: "Reference Caches",
    body: "##### Reference Caches  A Reference Cache is typically small and the number of elements to store in the reference caches is normally  known prior to creating the cache. Typical examples of reference caches are lookup tables for abbreviations or the states of a country. They tend to have a fixed but small element number and the eviction is an unlikely event, and rather undesirable behavior.  Since an imbalanced partition is a worse problem in small and mid-sized caches than in caches with millions of entries, the normal estimation rule (as discussed in a bit) is not applied to these kinds of caches. To prevent unwanted eviction on the small and mid-sized caches, Hazelcast implements a special set of rules to estimate the cluster size.  To adjust the imbalance of partitions as found in the typical runtime, the actual calculated maximum cache size (known as the eviction threshold) is slightly higher than the user defined size. That means more elements can be stored into the cache than expected by the user. This needs to be taken into account especially for large objects, since those can easily exceed the expected memory consumption!  **Small caches:**  If a cache is configured with no more than `4.000` elements, this cache is considered to be a small cache. The actual partition size is derived from the number of elements (`GlobalCapacity`) and the deviation using the following formula:  ```plain MaxPartitionSize := Deviation * 5 + BalancedPartitionSize ```  This formula ends up with big partition sizes which, summed up, exceed the expected maximum cache size (set by the user).  Since the small caches typically have a well known maximum number of elements, this is not a big issue. Only if the small caches are used for a use case other than as a reference cache, this needs to be taken into account.  **Mid-sized caches**  A mid-sized cache is defined as a cache with a maximum number of elements that is bigger than `4.000` but not bigger than `1.000.000` elements. The calculation of mid-sized caches is similar to that of the small caches but with a different multiplier. To calculate the maximum number of elements per partition, the following formula is used:  ```plain MaxPartitionSize := Deviation * 3 + BalancedPartitionSize ```  "

For more general information, please see the [Implementing EntryProcessor section](#implementing-entryprocessor).  Since Hazelcast provides backups of cached entries on other members, the default way to backup an object changed by an `EntryProcessor` is to serialize the complete object and send it to the backup partition. This can be a huge network overhead for big objects.  Hazelcast offers a sub-interface for `EntryProcessor` called `com.hazelcast.cache.BackupAwareEntryProcessor`. This allows you to create or pass another `EntryProcessor` to run on backup partitions and apply delta changes to the backup entries.  The backup partition `EntryProcessor` can either be the currently running processor (by returning `this`) or it can be a specialized `EntryProcessor` implementation (different from the currently running one) that does different operations or leaves out operations, e.g., sending emails.  If we again take the `EntryProcessor` example from the demonstration application provided in the [Implementing EntryProcessor section](#implementing-entryprocessor), the changed code will look like the following snippet.  ```java public class UserUpdateEntryProcessor     implements BackupAwareEntryProcessor&lt;Integer, User, User&gt; {    @Override   public User process( MutableEntry&lt;Integer, User&gt; entry, Object... arguments )       throws EntryProcessorException {      // Test arguments length     if ( arguments.length &lt; 1 ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException( \&quot;One argument needed: username\&quot; );     }      // Get first argument and test for String type     Object argument = arguments[0];     if ( !( argument instanceof String ) ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException(           \&quot;First argument has wrong type, required java.lang.String\&quot; );     }      // Retrieve the value from the MutableEntry     User user = entry.getValue();      // Retrieve the new username from the first argument     String newUsername = ( String ) arguments[0];      // Set the new username     user.setUsername( newUsername );      // Set the changed user to mark the entry as dirty     entry.setValue( user );      // Return the changed user to return it to the caller     return user;   }    public EntryProcessor&lt;K, V, T&gt; createBackupEntryProcessor() {     return this;   } } ```  You can use the additional method `BackupAwareEntryProcessor::createBackupEntryProcessor` to create or return the `EntryProcessor` implementation to run on the backup partition (in the example above, the same processor again).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *For the backup runs, the returned value from the backup processor is ignored and not returned to the user.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

By default, key and value are converted to their original types unless this `StorageTypeAwareCacheMergePolicy` is used.  Another motivation for using this interface is that at the member side, there is no need to locate classes of stored entries. Entries can be put from the client with `BINARY` in-memory format and the classpath of the client can be different from the member. So in this case, if entries try to convert to their original types while merging, `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown here.

This may be useful for some cases, such as SLA requirements. Hazelcast provides a property to specify this timeout: `hazelcast.spring.cache.prop`. This can be specified as a Java property (using `-D`) or you can add this property to your Spring properties file (usually named as `application.properties`).  A sample usage is given below:  ``` hazelcast.spring.cache.prop=defaultReadTimeout=2,cache1=10,cache2=20 ```  The argument `defaultReadTimeout` applies to all of your Spring caches. If you want to define different timeout values for some specific Spring caches, you can provide them as a comma separated list as shown in the above sample usage. The values are in milliseconds. If you want to have no timeout for a cache, simply set it to `0` or a negative value.    "

Modern hardware has much more available memory. If you want to make use of that hardware and scale up by specifying higher heap sizes, GC becomes an increasing problem: the application faces long GC pauses that make the application unresponsive. Also, you may get out of memory errors if you fill your whole heap. Garbage collection, which is the automatic process that manages the application's runtime memory, often forces you into configurations where multiple JVMs with small heaps (sizes of 2-4GB per member) run on a single physical hardware device to avoid garbage collection pauses. This results in oversized clusters to hold the data and leads to performance level requirements.  In &lt;font color=\&quot;##153F75\&quot;&gt;**Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD**&lt;/font&gt;, the High-Density Memory Store is Hazelcast's new enterprise in-memory storage solution. It solves garbage collection limitations so that applications can exploit hardware memory more efficiently without the need of oversized clusters. High-Density Memory Store is designed as a pluggable memory manager which enables multiple memory stores for different data structures. These memory stores are all accessible by a common access layer that scales up to terabytes of the main memory on a single JVM by minimizing the GC pressure. High-Density Memory Store enables predictable application scaling and boosts performance and latency while minimizing garbage collection pauses.  This foundation includes, but is not limited to, storing keys and values next to the heap in a native memory region.  High-Density Memory Store is currently provided for the following Hazelcast features and implementations:  - [Map](#using-high-density-memory-store-with-map) - JCache Implementation - [Near Cache](#near-cache) - [Hot Restart Persistence](#hot-restart-persistence) - [Java Client](#using-high-density-memory-store-with-java-client), when using the Near Cache for client - [Web Session Replications](#using-high-density-memory-store) - Hibernate 2nd Level Caching "

    body: "### Configuring High-Density Memory Store  To use the High-Density memory storage, the native memory usage must be enabled using the programmatic or declarative configuration. Also, you can configure its size, memory allocator type, minimum block size, page size and metadata space percentage.  - **size:** Size of the total native memory to allocate. Default value is **512 MB**. - **allocator type**: Type of the memory allocator. Available values are as follows:   * **STANDARD**: This option is used internally by Hazelcast's POOLED allocator type or for debugging/testing purposes. 	- With this option, the memory is allocated or deallocated using your operating system's default memory manager.    	- It uses GNU C Library's standard `malloc()` and `free()` methods which are subject to contention on multithreaded/multicore systems.   	- Memory operations may become slower when you perform a lot of small allocations and deallocations.    	- It may cause large memory fragmentations, unless you use a method in the background that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance, such as `jemalloc()`. Note that a large memory fragmentation can trigger the Linux Out of Memory Killer if there is no swap space enabled in your system. Even if the swap space is enabled, the killer can be again triggered if there is not enough swap space left.    	- If you still want to use the operating system's default memory management, you can set the allocator type to STANDARD in your native memory configuration.    * **POOLED**: This is the default option, Hazelcast's own pooling memory allocator.   	- With this option, memory blocks are managed using internal memory pools.    	- It allocates memory blocks, each of which has a 4MB page size by default, and splits them into chunks or merges them to create larger chunks when required. Sizing of these chunks follows the [buddy memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation) algorithm, i.e. power-of-two sizing.   	- It never frees memory blocks back to the operating system. It marks disposed memory blocks as available to be used later, meaning that these blocks are reusable.   	- Memory allocation and deallocation operations (except the ones requiring larger sizes than the page size) do not interact with the operating system mostly.   	- For memory allocation, it tries to find the requested memory size inside the internal memory pools. If it cannot be found, then it interacts with the operating system.     - **minimum block size:** Minimum size of the blocks in bytes to split and fragment a page block to assign to an allocation request. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Default value is **16**. - **page size:** Size of the page in bytes to allocate memory as a block. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Default value is `1 &lt;&lt; 22` = **4194304 Bytes**, about **4 MB**. - **metadata space percentage:** Defines the percentage of the allocated native memory that is used for internal memory structures by the High-Density Memory for tracking the used and available memory blocks. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Default value is **12.5**. Please note that when the memory runs out, you will get a Native `OutOfMemoryException`;  if your store has a big size of entries, you should consider increasing this percentage.  The following is the programmatic configuration example.  ```java MemorySize memorySize = new MemorySize(512, MemoryUnit.MEGABYTES); NativeMemoryConfig nativeMemoryConfig =                 new NativeMemoryConfig()                         .setAllocatorType(NativeMemoryConfig.MemoryAllocatorType.POOLED)                         .setSize(memorySize)                         .setEnabled(true)                         .setMinBlockSize(16)                         .setPageSize(1 &lt;&lt; 20); ```  The following is the declarative configuration example.  ```xml &lt;native-memory enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; allocator-type=\&quot;POOLED\&quot;&gt;   &lt;size value=\&quot;512\&quot; unit=\&quot;MEGABYTES\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/native-memory&gt; ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You can check whether there is enough free physical memory for the requested number of bytes using the system property `hazelcast.hidensity.check.freememory`.

If you use, for example, two backups, then the total memory footprint is three times the active data (active data + backup data + backup data).  If you use only heap memory, each Hazelcast member with a 4 GB heap should accommodate a maximum of 3.5 GB of total data (active and backup). If you use the High-Density Memory Store, up to 75% of the configured physical memory footprint may be used for active and backup data, with headroom of 25% for normal memory fragmentation. In both cases, however, you should also keep some memory headroom available to handle any member failure or explicit member shutdown. When a member leaves the cluster, the data previously owned by the newly offline member will be distributed among the remaining members. For this reason, we recommend that you plan to use only 60% of available memory, with 40% headroom to handle member failure or shutdown.   "

    body: "### Hot Restart Types  The Hot Restart feature is supported for the following restart types:  - **Restart after a planned shutdown**: 	- The cluster is shut down completely and restarted with the exact same previous setup and data.  		You can shut down the cluster completely using the method `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()` or you can manually change the cluster state to `PASSIVE` and then shut down each member one by one. When you send the command to shut the cluster down, i.e. `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()`, the members that are not in the `PASSIVE` state temporarily change their states to `PASSIVE`. Then, each member shuts itself down by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.  		Difference between explicitly changing state to `PASSIVE` before shutdown and shutting down cluster directly via `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()` is, on latter case when cluster is restarted, cluster state will be in the latest state before shutdown. That means if cluster is `ACTIVE` before shutdown, cluster state will automatically become `ACTIVE` after restart is completed.  	- Rolling restart: The cluster is restarted intentionally member by member. For example, this could be done to install an operating system patch or new hardware.  		To be able to shut down the cluster member by member as part of a planned restart, each member in the cluster should be in the `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE` state. After the cluster state is changed to `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE`, you can manually shut down each member by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`. When that member is restarted, it will rejoin the running cluster. After all members are restarted, the cluster state can be changed back to `ACTIVE`.  - **Restart after a cluster crash**: The cluster is restarted after all its members crashed at the same time due to a power outage, networking interruptions, etc.  "

Once all cluster members are started, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to `PASSIVE` and starts to load data. When all data is loaded, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to its previous known state before shutdown and starts to accept the operations which are allowed by the restored cluster state.  If a member fails to either start, join the cluster in time (within the timeout), or load its data, then that member will be terminated immediately. After the problems causing the failure are fixed, that member can be restarted. If the cluster start cannot be completed in time, then all members will fail to start. Please refer to the [Configuring Hot Restart section](#configuring-hot-restart) for defining timeouts.  In the case of a restart after a cluster crash, the Hot Restart feature realizes that it was not a clean shutdown and Hazelcast tries to restart the cluster with the last saved data following the process explained above. In some cases, specifically when the cluster crashes while it has an ongoing partition migration process, currently it is not possible to restore the last saved state.  "

Since only a single member has failed, the cluster performed the standard High Availability routine by recovering member B's data from backups and redistributing the data among the remaining members (the single member A in this case). Member B's persisted Hot Restart data is completely irrelevant.  Furthermore, when a member starts with existing Hot Restart data, it expects to find itself within a cluster that has been shut down as a whole and is now restarting as a whole. Since the reality is that the cluster has been running all along, member B's persisted cluster state does not match the actual state. Therefore, member B aborts initialization and shuts down.  As another scenario, assume the following:  - You have a cluster consisting of members A and B with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable. - Member B is killed. - Member B's Hot Restart [base directory(`base-dir`)](#configuring-hot-restart) is deleted. - Member B restarts.

Data belonging to those missing members will be assumed lost and Hazelcast will try to recover missing data using the restored backups.  For example, if you have minimum two backups configured for all maps and caches, then a partial start up to two missing members will be safe against data loss. If there are more than two missing members or there are maps/caches with less than two backups, then data loss is expected.  Partial start is controlled by `cluster-data-recovery-policy` configuration parameter and is not allowed by default. To enable partial start, one of the configuration values `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT` or `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE` should be set. Please see [Configuring Hot Restart section](#configuring-hot-restart) for details.  When partial start is enabled, Hazelcast can perform a partial start automatically or manually, in case of some members are unable to restart successfully. Partial start proceeds automatically when some members fail to start and join to the cluster in `validation-timeout-seconds`. After the `validation-timeout-seconds` duration is passed, Hot Restart chooses to perform partial start with the members present in the cluster. Moreover, partial start can be requested manually using the [Management Center](#hot-restart), [REST API](#using-rest-api-for-cluster-management) and [cluster management scripts](#example-usages-for-cluster-sh) before the `validation-timeout-seconds` duration passes.  The other situation to decide to perform a partial start is failures during the data load phase. When Hazelcast learns data load result of all members which have passed the validation step, it automatically performs a partial start with the ones which have successfully restored their Hot Restart data. Please note that partial start does not expect every member to succeed in the data load step. It completes the process when it learns data load result for every member and there is at least one member which has successfully restored its Hot Restart data. Relatedly, if it cannot learn data load result of all members before `data-load-timeout-seconds` duration, it proceeds with the ones which have already completed the data load process.  Selection of members to perform partial start among live members is done according to the `cluster-data-recovery-policy` configuration. Set of members which are not selected by the `cluster-data-recovery-policy` are called `Excluded members`, and they are instructed to perform [force start](#force-start). Excluded members are allowed to join cluster only when they clean their Hot Restart data and make a fresh-new start. This is a completely automatic process. For instance, if you start the missing members after partial start is completed, they clean their Hot Restart data and join to the cluster.  Please note that partial start is a destructive process. Once it is completed, it cannot be repeated with a new configuration. For this reason, one may need to perform the partial start process manually. Automatic behavior of partial start relies on `validation-timeout-seconds` and `data-load-timeout-seconds` configuration values. If you need to control the process manually, `validation-timeout-seconds` and `data-load-timeout-seconds` properties can be set to very big values so that Hazelcast cannot make progress on timeouts automatically. Then, the overall process can be managed manually via aforementioned methods, i.e. Management Center, REST API and cluster management scripts.  "

    body: "### Configuring Hot Restart  You can configure Hot Restart programmatically or declaratively. The configuration includes elements to enable/disable the feature, to specify the directory where the Hot Restart data will be stored, and to define timeout values.  The following are the descriptions of the Hot Restart configuration elements.  - `hot-restart-persistence`: The configuration that enables the Hot Restart feature. It includes the element `base-dir` that is used to specify the directory where the Hot Restart data will be stored. The default value for `base-dir` is `hot-restart`. You can use the default value, or you can specify the value of another folder containing the Hot Restart configuration, but it is mandatory that this `hot-restart` element has a value. This directory will be created automatically if it does not exist. A single `base-dir` can be used only and only by a single Hazelcast member, it cannot be shared by multiple members. An attempt to use the same `base-dir` by multiple members will make these members abort the startup process except one which wins the ownership of the directory. - `parallelism`: Level of parallelism in Hot Restart Persistence. There will be this many IO threads, each writing in parallel to its own files. During the Hot Restart procedure, this many IO threads will be reading the files and this many rebuilder threads will be rebuilding the Hot Restart metadata. The default value for this property is 1. This is a good default in most but not all cases. You should measure the raw IO throughput of your infrastructure and test with different values of parallelism. In some cases such as dedicated hardware higher parallelism can yield more throughput of Hot Restart. In other cases such as running on EC2, it can yield diminishing returns - more thread scheduling, more contention on IO and less efficient garbage collection. - `validation-timeout-seconds`: Validation timeout for the Hot Restart process when validating the cluster members expected to join and the partition table on the whole cluster. - `data-load-timeout-seconds`: Data load timeout for the Hot Restart process. All members in the cluster should finish restoring their local data before this timeout. - `cluster-data-recovery-policy`: Specifies the data recovery policy that will be respected during Hot Restart cluster start. Valid values are;     * `FULL_RECOVERY_ONLY`: Starts the cluster only when all expected members are present and correct. Otherwise, it fails. This is the default value.     * `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT`: Starts the cluster with the members which have most up-to-date partition table and successfully restored their data. All other members will leave the cluster and force start themselves. If no member restores its data successfully, cluster start fails.	          * `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE`: Starts the cluster with the largest group of members which have the same partition table version and successfully restored their data. All other members will leave the cluster and force start themselves. If no member restores its data successfully, cluster start fails. - `hot-restart`: The configuration that enables or disables the Hot Restart feature per data structure. This element is used for the supported data structures (in the above examples, you can see that it is included in `map` and `cache`). Turning on `fsync` guarantees that data is persisted to the disk device when a write operation returns successful response to the caller. By default, `fsync` is turned off. That means data will be persisted to the disk device eventually, instead of on every disk write. This generally provides better performance.  "

Having a new IP address does not affect Hot Restart, since it does not rely on the IP address of the server but instead uses `Member` UUID as a unique identifier.  This flexibility provides; - ability to replace one or more faulty servers with new ones easily without touching remaining cluster - ability to use Hot Restart on cloud environments easily. Sometimes cloud providers do not preserve IP addresses on restart or after shutdown. Also it is possible to startup whole cluster on a different set of machines. - ability to copy production data to test environment, so that a more functional test cluster can bet setup    Unfortunately having different number of CPU cores is not that straightforward. Hazelcast partition threads, by default, will use a heuristic from the number of cores, e.g., `# of partition threads = # of CPU cores`. When Hazelcast member is started on a server with a different CPU core count, number of Hazelcast partition threads will change and that will make Hot Restart fail during startup. Solution is to explicitly set number of Hazelcast partition threads (`hazelcast.operation.thread.count` system property) and Hot Restart `parallelism` configuration and use the same parameters on the new server.

The following is a top-level design description:  - The only kind of update operation on persistent data is _appending_. - What is appended are facts about events that happened to the data model represented by the store; either a new value was assigned to a key or a key was removed. - Each record associated with a key makes stale the previous record that was associated with that key. - Stale records contribute to the amount of _garbage_ present in the persistent storage. - Measures are taken to remove garbage from the storage.  This kind of design focuses almost all of the system's complexity into the garbage collection (GC) process, stripping down the client's operation to the bare necessity of guaranteeing persistent behavior: a simple file append operation. Consequently, the latency of operations is close to the theoretical minimum in almost all cases. Complications arise only during prolonged periods of maximum load; this is where the details of the GC process begin to matter.  "

    body: "### Concurrent, Incremental, Generational GC  In order to maintain the lowest possible footprint in the update operation latency, the following properties are built into the garbage collection process:  - A dedicated thread performs the GC. In Hazelcast terms, this thread is called the Collector and the application thread is called the Mutator. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - On each update there is metadata to be maintained; this is done asynchronously by the Collector thread. The Mutator enqueues update events to the Collector's work queue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - The Collector keeps draining its work queue at all times, including the time it goes through the GC cycle. Updates are taken into account at each stage in the GC cycle, preventing the copying of already dead records into compacted files. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - All GC-induced I/O competes for the same resources as the Mutator's update operations. Therefore, measures are taken to minimize the impact of I/O done during GC:   - data is never read from files, but from RAM;   - a heuristic scheme is employed which minimizes the number of bytes written to disk for each kilobyte of reclaimed garbage;   - measures are also taken to achieve a good interleaving of Collector and Mutator operations, minimizing latency outliers perceived by the Mutator.

In other words, a key updated now is more likely than average to be updated again soon.  The scheme was taken from the seminal Sprite LFS paper, [Rosenblum, Ousterhout, _The Design and Implementation of a Log-Structured File System_](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/LFS.pdf). The following is an outline of the paper:  - Data is not written to one huge file, but to many files of moderate size (8 MB) called \&quot;chunks\&quot;. - Garbage is collected incrementally, i.e. by choosing several chunks, then copying all their live data to new chunks, then deleting the old ones. - I/O is minimized using a collection technique which results in a bimodal distribution of chunks with respect to their garbage content: most files are either almost all live data or they are all garbage. - The technique consists of two main principles:     1. Chunks are selected based on their _Cost-Benefit factor_ (see below).     2. Records are sorted by age before copying to new chunks.  "

The ratio of benefit (amount of garbage that can be collected) to I/O cost (amount of live data to be written). 2. The age of the data in the chunk, measured as the age of the youngest record it contains.  The essence is in the second component: given equal amount of garbage in all chunks, it will make the young ones less attractive to the Collector. Assuming the generational garbage hypothesis, this will allow the young chunks to quickly accumulate more garbage. On the flip side, it will also ensure that even files with little garbage are eventually garbage collected. This removes garbage which would otherwise linger on, thinly spread across many chunk files.  Sorting records by age will group young records together in a single chunk and will do the same for older records. Therefore the chunks will either tend to keep their data live for a longer time, or quickly become full of garbage.  "

The member which receives the backup request will determine a new backup sequence ID and send that information to all members. If all members respond that no other backup is currently in progress and that no other backup request has already been made, then the coordinating member will command the other members to start the actual backup process. This will create a directory under the configured `backup-dir` with the name `backup-&lt;backupSeq&gt;` and start copying the data from the original store.  The backup process is initiated nearly instantaneously on all members. Note that since there is no limitation as to when the backup process is initiated, it may be initiated during membership changes, partition table changes or during normal data update. Some of these operations may not be completed fully yet, which means that some members will backup some data while some members will backup a previous version of the same data. This will usually be solved by the anti-entropy mechanism on the new cluster which will reconcile different versions of the same data. Please check the [Achieving High Consistency of Backup Data section](#achieving-high-consistency-of-backup-data) for more information.

The hot backup process will use hard links whenever possible because they provide big performance benefits and because the backups share disk usage.   The performance benefit comes from the fact that Hot Restart file contents are not being duplicated (thus using disk and IO resources) but rather a new file name is created for the same contents on disk (another pointer to the same inode). Since all backups and stores share the same inode, disk usage drops.   The bigger the percentage of stable data in the Hot Restart Store (data not undergoing changes), the more files will each backup share with the operational Hot Restart Store and the less disk space it will be using.

An example of how to track the progress via API is shown below:  ```java HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); HotRestartStateImpl status = service.getBackupTaskStatus(); ... ```  The returned object contains local member backup status:  - the backup state (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, FAILURE, SUCCESS) - the completed count - the total count   The completed and total count can provide you a way to track the percentage of the copied data. Currently the count defines the number of copied and total local member Hot Restart Stores (defined by `HotRestartPersistenceConfig#setParallelism`) but this can change at a later point to provide greater resolution.  Besides tracking the Hot Restart status by API, you can view the status in the management center and you can inspect the on-disk files for each member. Each member creates an `inprogress` file which is created in each of the copied Hot Restart Stores. This means that the backup is currently in progress.

This is helpful in situations where the backup task has started at an inconvenient time. For instance, the backup task could be automatized and it could be accidentally triggered during high load on the Hazelcast instances, causing the performance of the Hazelcast instances to drop.  The backup task mainly uses disk IO, consumes little CPU and it generally does not last for a long time (although you should test it with your environment to determine the exact impact). Nevertheless, you can abort the backup tasks on all members via a cluster-wide interrupt operation. This operation can be triggered programmatically or from the management center.   An example of programmatic interruption is shown below:  ```java HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); service.interruptBackupTask(); ... ```  This method will send an interrupt to all members. The interrupt is ignored if the backup task is currently not in progress so you can safely call this method even though it has previously been called or when some members have already completed their local backup tasks.  You can also interrupt the local member backup task as shown below:  ```java HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); service.interruptLocalBackupTask(); ... ```  The backup task will stop as soon as possible and it will not remove the disk contents of the backup directory meaning that you must remove it manually.

You have the flexibility to run multiple applications off a single database, keeping Hazelcast cache refreshes current while adhering to low latency SLAs.  This joint solution with Hazelcast's in-memory data grid uses Striim's Change Data Capture (CDC) to solve the cache consistency problems.  When you have an application that needs to retrieve and store information in a database, you can use a Hazelcast in-memory cache for rapid access to data. There may be some other applications that make database updates; in this case, your application may show out-of-date or invalid information.  Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache solves this by using streaming CDC to synchronize the cache with the database in real time. This ensures that both the cache and your application always have the most current data.  Through CDC, Striim is able to recognize which tables and key values have changed. It immediately captures these changes with their table and key, and, using the Hazelcast Striim writer, pushes those changes into the cache.

Native Clients enable you to perform almost all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the cluster. It connects to one of the cluster members and delegates all cluster wide operations to it (_dummy client_), or it connects to all of them and delegates operations smartly (_smart client_). When the relied cluster member dies, the client will transparently switch to another live member.  Hundreds or even thousands of clients can be connected to the cluster. By default, there are *core count* * *10* threads on the server side that will handle all the requests, e.g., if the server has 4 cores, there will be 40 threads.  Imagine a trading application where all the trading data are stored and managed in a Hazelcast cluster with tens of members. Swing/Web applications at the traders' desktops can use Native Clients to access and modify the data in the Hazelcast cluster.  Currently, Hazelcast has Java, C++ and .NET Clients as native clients. This chapter describes the Java Client.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***IMPORTANT:*** *Starting with Hazelcast 3.5, a new Java Native Client Library is introduced in the release package. This library contains clients which use the new Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol.*  * *For 3.5.x releases: You can use the new client experimentally with the library `hazelcast-client-new`. This library does not exist for the releases before 3.5. Please do not use this library with the Hazelcast clusters from 3.6.x and higher releases since it is not compatible with those releases.*  * *For 3.6.x releases: You can use the new client with the library `hazelcast-client`. The old client's library is `hazelcast-client-legacy`, and you can still use it.* * *For 3.7.x and higher releases: There is no more old client for these releases. The only one is the `hazelcast-client` library, which includes clients implemented with the Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol.*  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  "

Since each data partition uses the well known and consistent hashing algorithm, each client can send an operation to the relevant cluster member, which increases the overall throughput and efficiency. Smart mode is the default mode.   **Dummy Client**: For some cases, the clients can be required to connect to a single member instead of to each member in the cluster. Firewalls, security, or some custom networking issues can be the reason for these cases.  In dummy client mode, the client will only connect to one of the configured addresses. This single member will behave as a gateway to the other members. For any operation requested from the client, it will redirect the request to the relevant member and return the response back to the client returned from this member.  "

This configuration will change the behavior of `HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient()` call. It'll return a client instance without waiting to establish a cluster connection. Until the client connects to cluster, it will throw `HazelcastClientOfflineException` on any network dependent operations hence they won't block. If you want to check or wait the client to complete its cluster connection, you can use the built-in lifecycle listener:   ```java ClientStateListener clientStateListener = new ClientStateListener(clientConfig); HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);   //Client started but may not be connected to cluster yet.   //check connection status clientStateListener.isConnected();    //blocks until client completes connect to cluster  if (clientStateListener.awaitConnected()) { 	//connected successfully } else { 	//client failed to connect to cluster } ```   Java client can also be configured to specify how it reconnects after a cluster disconnection. There are three options:  * A client can reject to reconnect to the cluster and trigger the client shutdown process. * Client can open a connection to the cluster by blocking all waiting invocations. * Client can open a connection to the cluster without blocking the waiting invocations. All invocations will receive `HazelcastClientOfflineException` during the establishment of cluster connection. If cluster connection is failed to connect, then client shutdown will be triggered.

    title: "Configuring Java Client",
    body: "## Configuring Java Client  You can configure Hazelcast Java Client declaratively (XML) or programmatically (API).  For declarative configuration, the Hazelcast client looks at the following places for the client configuration file.  - **System property**: The client first checks if `hazelcast.client.config` system property is set to a file path, e.g., `-Dhazelcast.client.config=C:/myhazelcast.xml`.  - **Classpath**: If config file is not set as a system property, the client checks the classpath for `hazelcast-client.xml` file.  If the client does not find any configuration file, it starts with the default configuration (`hazelcast-client-default.xml`) located in the `hazelcast-client.jar` library. Before configuring the client, please try to work with the default configuration to see if it works for you. The default should be just fine for most users. If not, then consider custom configuration for your environment.  If you want to specify your own configuration file to create a `Config` object, the Hazelcast client supports the following.  - `Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build();`  - `Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();`   For programmatic configuration of the Hazelcast Java Client, just instantiate a `ClientConfig` object and configure the desired aspects.

Let's recall the Java client's Near Cache configuration (please see the [Configuring Client Near Cache section](#configuring-client-near-cache)) **without** High-Density Memory Store:  ```xml &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt;     ...     ...     &lt;near-cache name=\&quot;MENU\&quot;&gt;         &lt;max-size&gt;2000&lt;/max-size&gt;         &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;0&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt;         &lt;max-idle-seconds&gt;0&lt;/max-idle-seconds&gt;         &lt;eviction-policy&gt;LFU&lt;/eviction-policy&gt;         &lt;invalidate-on-change&gt;true&lt;/invalidate-on-change&gt;         &lt;in-memory-format&gt;OBJECT&lt;/in-memory-format&gt;     &lt;/near-cache&gt;     ... &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ```  You can configure this Near Cache to use Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store by setting the in-memory format to NATIVE. Please see the following configuration example:  ```xml &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt;     ...     ...     &lt;near-cache&gt;        ...        &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;0&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt;        &lt;max-idle-seconds&gt;0&lt;/max-idle-seconds&gt;        &lt;invalidate-on-change&gt;true&lt;/invalidate-on-change&gt;        &lt;in-memory-format&gt;NATIVE&lt;/in-memory-format&gt;        &lt;eviction size=\&quot;1000\&quot; max-size-policy=\&quot;ENTRY_COUNT\&quot; eviction-policy=\&quot;LFU\&quot;/&gt;        ...     &lt;/near-cache&gt; &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ```   Please notice that when the in-memory format is NATIVE, i.e. High-Density Memory Store is enabled, the configuration element `&lt;eviction&gt;` is used to specify the eviction behavior of your client's Near Cache. In this case, the elements `&lt;max-size&gt;` and `&lt;eviction-policy&gt;` used in the configuration of a Near Cache without High-Density Memory Store do not have any impact.   The element `&lt;eviction&gt;` has the following attributes:  - `size`: Maximum size (entry count) of the Near Cache. - `max-size-policy`: Maximum size policy for eviction of the Near Cache. Available values are as follows: 	* ENTRY_COUNT: Maximum entry count per member. 	* USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE: Maximum used native memory size in megabytes. 	* USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: Maximum used native memory percentage. 	* FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE: Minimum free native memory size to trigger cleanup. 	* FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: Minimum free native memory percentage to trigger cleanup. - `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy configuration. Its default values is NONE. Available values are as follows: 	- NONE: No items will be evicted and the property max-size will be ignored. You still can combine it with time-to-live-seconds. 	- LRU: 	Least Recently Used. 	- LFU: 	Least Frequently Used.  Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store usage for your client, using the `&lt;native-memory&gt;` element in the client's configuration.  Please see the [High-Density Memory Store section](#high-density-memory-store) for more information on Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store feature.        "

The features of C++ Clients are listed below:  - Access to distributed data structures (IMap, IQueue, MultiMap, ITopic, etc.). - Access to transactional distributed data structures (TransactionalMap, TransactionalQueue, etc.). - Ability to add cluster listeners to a cluster and entry/item listeners to distributed data structures. - Distributed synchronization mechanisms with ILock, ISemaphore and ICountDownLatch.

All you need to do is have your PHP Memcache client connect to one of these members. It does not matter which member the client connects to because the Hazelcast cluster looks like one giant machine (Single System Image). Here is a PHP client code example.  ```php &lt;?php   $memcache = new Memcache;   $memcache-&gt;connect( '10.20.17.1', 5701 ) or die ( \&quot;Could not connect\&quot; );   $memcache-&gt;set( 'key1', 'value1', 0, 3600 );   $get_result = $memcache-&gt;get( 'key1' ); // retrieve your data   var_dump( $get_result ); // show it ?&gt; ```  Notice that Memcache client connects to `10.20.17.1` and uses port `5701`. Here is a Java client code example with SpyMemcached client:  ```java MemcachedClient client = new MemcachedClient(     AddrUtil.getAddresses( \&quot;10.20.17.1:5701 10.20.17.2:5701\&quot; ) ); client.set( \&quot;key1\&quot;, 3600, \&quot;value1\&quot; ); System.out.println( client.get( \&quot;key1\&quot; ) ); ```  If you want your data to be stored in different maps, for example to utilize per map configuration, you can do that with a map name prefix as in the following example code.   ```java MemcachedClient client = new MemcachedClient(     AddrUtil.getAddresses( \&quot;10.20.17.1:5701 10.20.17.2:5701\&quot; ) ); client.set( \&quot;map1:key1\&quot;, 3600, \&quot;value1\&quot; ); // store to *hz_memcache_map1 client.set( \&quot;map2:key1\&quot;, 3600, \&quot;value1\&quot; ); // store to hz_memcache_map2 System.out.println( client.get( \&quot;key1\&quot; ) ); // get from hz_memcache_map1 System.out.println( client.get( \&quot;key2\&quot; ) ); // get from hz_memcache_map2 ```  *hz\_memcache prefix\_* separates Memcache maps from Hazelcast maps. If no map name is given, it will be stored in a default map named *hz_memcache_default*.  An entry written with a Memcache client can be read by another Memcache client written in another language.

    body: "# Serialization  Hazelcast needs to serialize the Java objects that you put into Hazelcast because Hazelcast is a distributed system. The data and its replicas are stored in different partitions on multiple cluster members. The data you need may not be present on the local member, and in that case, Hazelcast retrieves that data from another member. This requires serialization.  Hazelcast serializes all your objects into an instance of `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.Data`. `Data` is the binary representation of an object.   Serialization is used when:  - key/value objects are added to a map, - items are put in a queue/set/list, - a runnable is sent using an executor service, - an entry processing is performed within a map, - an object is locked, and - a message is sent to a topic.   Hazelcast optimizes the serialization for the basic types and their array types. You cannot override this behavior.  **Default Types**;   * Byte, Boolean, Character, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String * byte[], boolean[], char[], short[], int[], long[], float[], double[], String[] * `java.util.Date`, `java.math.BigInteger`, `java.math.BigDecimal`, `java.lang.Class`  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hazelcast optimizes all of the above object types.

When Hazelcast serializes an object into `Data`:  **(1)** It first checks whether the object is `null`.  **(2)** If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializable` or `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable`.  **(3)** If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.Portable`.  **(4)** If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of one of the default types (see the [Serialization chapter introduction](#serialization) for default types).  **(5)** If the above check fails, then Hazelcast looks for a user-specified [Custom Serializer](#custom-serialization), i.e. an implementation of `ByteArraySerializer` or `StreamSerializer`. Custom serializer is searched using the input Object's Class and its parent class up to Object. If parent class search fails, all interfaces implemented by the class are also checked (excluding `java.io.Serializable` and `java.io.Externalizable`).   **(6)** If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of `java.io.Serializable` or `java.io.Externalizable` and a Global Serializer is not registered with Java Serialization Override feature.  **(7)** If the above check fails, Hazelcast will use the registered Global Serializer if one exists.  If all of the above checks fail, then serialization will fail. When a class implements multiple interfaces, the above steps are important to determine the serialization mechanism that Hazelcast will use. When a class definition is required for any of these serializations, you need to have all the classes needed by the application on your classpath because Hazelcast does not download them automatically.

Let's take a look at the example code below for Java Serializable.  ```java public class Employee implements Serializable {    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;   private String surname;      public Employee( String surname ) {      this.surname = surname;   }  } ```  Here, the fields that are non-static and non-transient are automatically serialized. To eliminate class compatibility issues, it is recommended that you add a `serialVersionUID`, as shown above. Also, when you are using methods that perform byte-content comparisons, such as `IMap.replace()`, and if byte-content of equal objects is different, you may face unexpected behaviors. For example, if the class relies on a hash map, the `replace` method may fail. The reason for this is the hash map is a serialized data structure with unreliable byte-content.  "

However, it does not control how fields are serialized or deserialized. Moreover, Java serialization can lead to excessive CPU loads since it keeps track of objects to handle the cycles and streams class descriptors. These are performance decreasing factors; thus, serialized data may not have an optimal size.  The `DataSerializable` interface of Hazelcast overcomes these issues. Here is an example of a class implementing the `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializable` interface.  ```java public class Address implements DataSerializable {   private String street;   private int zipCode;   private String city;   private String state;    public Address() {}    //getters setters..    public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException {     out.writeUTF(street);     out.writeInt(zipCode);     out.writeUTF(city);     out.writeUTF(state);   }    public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {     street = in.readUTF();     zipCode = in.readInt();     city = in.readUTF();     state = in.readUTF();   } } ```  "

Also note that you should have writing and reading of the fields occur  in the same order. When Hazelcast serializes a `DataSerializable`, it writes the `className` first. When Hazelcast deserializes it, `className` is used to instantiate the object using reflection.   ```java public class Employee implements DataSerializable {   private String firstName;   private String lastName;   private int age;   private double salary;   private Address address; //address itself is DataSerializable    public Employee() {}    //getters setters..    public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException {     out.writeUTF(firstName);     out.writeUTF(lastName);     out.writeInt(age);     out.writeDouble (salary);     address.writeData (out);   }    public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {     firstName = in.readUTF();     lastName = in.readUTF();     age = in.readInt();     salary = in.readDouble();     address = new Address();     // since Address is DataSerializable let it read its own internal state     address.readData(in);   } } ```  As you can see, since the `address` field itself is `DataSerializable`, it calls `address.writeData(out)` when writing and `address.readData(in)` when reading.

In order to support these features, a serialized Portable object contains meta information like the version and the concrete location of the each field in the binary data. This way, Hazelcast navigates in the `byte[]` and deserializes only the required field without actually deserializing the whole object. This improves the Query performance.  With multi-version support, you can have two cluster members where each has different versions of the same object. Hazelcast will store both meta information and use the correct one to serialize and deserialize Portable objects depending on the member. This is very helpful when you are doing a rolling upgrade without shutting down the cluster.  Portable serialization is totally language independent and is used as the binary protocol between Hazelcast server and clients.  "

The Factory object creates the Portable object given the `classId`.  An example `Factory` could be implemented as follows:  ```java public class MyPortableFactory implements PortableFactory {    @Override   public Portable create( int classId ) {     if ( Foo.ID == classId )       return new Foo();     else       return null;   } }             ```  "

For example, a client may have an older version of a class, and the member to which it is connected may have a newer version of the same class.   Portable serialization supports versioning. It is a global versioning, meaning that all portable classes that are serialized through a member get the globally configured portable version.  You can declare Version in the configuration file `hazelcast.xml` using the `portable-version` element, as shown below.  ```xml &lt;serialization&gt;   &lt;portable-version&gt;1&lt;/portable-version&gt;   &lt;portable-factories&gt;     &lt;portable-factory factory-id=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;         PortableFactoryImpl     &lt;/portable-factory&gt;   &lt;/portable-factories&gt; &lt;/serialization&gt; ```  You can also use the interface &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/nio/serialization/VersionedPortable.java\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;VersionedPortable&lt;/a&gt; which enables to upgrade the version per class, instead of global versioning. If you need to update only one class, you can use this interface. In this case, your class should implement `VersionedPortable` instead of `Portable`, and you can give the desired version using the method `VersionedPortable.getClassVersion()`.  You should consider the following when you perform versioning.  - It is important to change the version whenever an update is performed in the serialized fields of a class, for example by incrementing the version. - If a client performs a Portable deserialization on a field, and then that Portable is updated by removing that field on the cluster side, this may lead to a problem. - Portable serialization does not use reflection and hence, fields in the class and in the serialized content are not automatically mapped. Field renaming is a simpler process. Also, since the class ID is stored, renaming the Portable does not lead to problems. - Types of fields need to be updated carefully.

The last required step is to register the `StreamSerializer` in your Hazelcast configuration. Below are the programmatic and declarative configurations for this step.  ```java SerializerConfig sc = new SerializerConfig()     .setImplementation(new FooXmlSerializer())     .setTypeClass(Foo.class); Config config = new Config(); config.getSerializationConfig().addSerializerConfig(sc); ```   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;serialization&gt;     &lt;serializers&gt;       &lt;serializer type-class=\&quot;com.www.Foo\&quot; class-name=\&quot;com.www.FooXmlSerializer\&quot; /&gt;     &lt;/serializers&gt;   &lt;/serialization&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  From now on, this Hazelcast example will use `FooXmlSerializer` to serialize Foo objects. In this way, you can write an adapter (StreamSerializer) for any Serialization framework and plug it into Hazelcast.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***   *Please refer to the [Serialization Configuration Wrap-Up section](#serialization-configuration-wrap-up) for a full description of Hazelcast Serialization configuration.*    "

The global serializer is registered as a fallback serializer to handle all other objects if a serializer cannot be located for them.  By default, the global serializer does not handle `java.io.Serializable` and `java.io.Externalizable` instances. However, you can configure it to be responsible for those instances.  A custom serializer should be registered for a specific class type. The global serializer will handle all class types if all the steps in searching for a serializer fail as described in [Serialization Interface Types](#serialization-interface-types).   **Use cases**  * Third party serialization frameworks can be integrated using the global serializer.  * For your custom objects, you can implement a single serializer to handle all of them.   * You can replace the internal Java serialization by enabling the `overrideJavaSerialization` option of the global serializer configuration.   Any custom serializer can be used as the global serializer. Please refer to the [Custom Serialization section](#custom-serialization) for implementation details.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *To function properly, Hazelcast needs the Java serializable objects to be handled correctly. If the global serializer is configured to handle the Java serialization, the global serializer must properly serialize/deserialize the `java.io.Serializable` instances.

Let's implement it for the `Employee` class mentioned in the [Custom Serialization section](#custom-serialization).  ```java public class Employee     implements Serializable, HazelcastInstanceAware {        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;   private String surname;   private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;    public Person( String surname ) {      this.surname = surname;   }    @Override   public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) {     this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;     System.out.println( \&quot;HazelcastInstance set\&quot; );    }    @Override   public String toString() {     return String.format( \&quot;Person(surname=%s)\&quot;, surname );    } } ```   After deserialization, the object is checked to see if it implements `HazelcastInstanceAware` and the method `setHazelcastInstance` is called. Notice the `hazelcastInstance` is `transient`. This is because this field should not be serialized.  It may be a good practice to inject a HazelcastInstance into a domain object, e.g., `Employee` in the above sample, when used together with `Runnable`/`Callable` implementations. These runnables/callables are executed by `IExecutorService` which sends them to another machine. And after a task is deserialized, run/call method implementations need to access HazelcastInstance.  We recommend you only set the HazelcastInstance field while using `setHazelcastInstance` method and you not execute operations on the HazelcastInstance. The reason is that when HazelcastInstance is injected for a `HazelcastInstanceAware` implementation, it may not be up and running at the injection time.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"

Portable version differentiates two of the same classes that have changes, such as adding/removing field or changing a type of a field. - `use-native-byte-order`: Set to `true` to use native byte order for the underlying platform.  - `byte-order`: Defines the byte order that the serialization will use: `BIG_ENDIAN` or `LITTLE_ENDIAN`. The default value is `BIG_ENDIAN`. - `enable-compression`: Enables compression if default Java serialization is used.  - `enable-shared-object`: Enables shared object if default Java serialization is used.  - `allow-unsafe`: Set to `true` to allow `unsafe` to be used.  - `data-serializable-factory`: The DataSerializableFactory class to be registered. - `portable-factory`: The PortableFactory class to be registered. - `global-serializer`: The global serializer class to be registered if no other serializer is applicable. - `serializer`: The class name of the serializer implementation. - `check-class-def-errors`: When set to `true`, the serialization system will check for class definitions error at start and will throw a Serialization Exception with an error definition.

The other way to connect is to use a custom JMX client.   First, you need to specify the URL where the Hazelcast JMX service is running. Please see the following sample code snippet. The `port` in this sample should be the one that you define while setting the JMX remote port number (if different than the default port `1099`).   ```java // Parameters for connecting to the JMX Service int port = 1099; String hostname = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName(); JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL(\&quot;service:jmx:rmi://\&quot; + hostname + \&quot;:\&quot; + port + \&quot;/jndi/rmi://\&quot; + hostname + \&quot;:\&quot; + port + \&quot;/jmxrmi\&quot;); ```  Then use the URL you acquired to connect to the JMX service and get the `JMXConnector` object. Using this object, get the `MBeanServerConnection` object. The `MBeanServerConnection` object will enable you to use the MBean methods. Please see the example code below.   ```java // Connect to the JMX Service JMXConnector jmxc = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(url, null); MBeanServerConnection mbsc = jmxc.getMBeanServerConnection(); ```  Once you get the `MBeanServerConnection` object, you can call the getter methods of MBeans as follows:  ```java System.out.println(\&quot;\nTotal entries on map \&quot; + mbsc.getAttribute(mapMBeanName, \&quot;name\&quot;) + \&quot; : \&quot;                 + mbsc.getAttribute(mapMBeanName, \&quot;localOwnedEntryCount\&quot;)); ```               "

    body: "#### Cluster States  By changing the state of your cluster, you can allow/restrict several cluster operations or change the behavior of those operations. You can use the methods `changeClusterState()` and `shutdown()` which are in the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.java\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Cluster interface&lt;/a&gt; to change your cluster's state.   Hazelcast clusters have the following states:  - **`ACTIVE`**: This is the default cluster state. Cluster continues to operate without restrictions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - **`NO_MIGRATION`**:     - In this state, migrations (partition rebalancing) and backup replications are not allowed.     - The cluster accepts new members.     - All other operations are allowed.     - You cannot change the state of a cluster to `NO_MIGRATION` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.     - When you want to add multiple new members to the cluster, you can first change the cluster state to `NO_MIGRATION`, then start the new members. Once all of them join to the cluster, you can change the cluster state back to `ACTIVE`. Then, the cluster will rebalance partition replica distribution at once. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - **`FROZEN`**: 	- In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed. 	- The cluster does not accept new members. 	- If a member leaves, it can join back. Its partition assignments (both primary and backup replicas) remain the same until either it joins back or the cluster state is changed to `ACTIVE`. When it joins back to the cluster, it will own all previous partition assignments as it was. On the other hand, when the cluster state changes to `ACTIVE`, re-partitioning starts and unassigned partition replicas are assigned to the active members. 	- All other operations in the cluster, except migration, continue without restrictions. 	- You cannot change the state of a cluster to `FROZEN` when migration/replication tasks are being performed. 	- You can make use of `FROZEN` state along with the [Hot Restart Persistence](#hot-restart-persistence) feature. You can change the cluster state to `FROZEN`, then restart some of your members using the Hot Restart feature. The data on the restarting members will not be accessible but you will be able to access to the data that is stored in other members. Basically, `FROZEN` cluster state allows you do perform maintenance on your members with degrading availability partially. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - **`PASSIVE`**: 	- In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.  	- The cluster does not accept new members. 	- If a member leaves while the cluster is in this state, the member will be removed from the partition table if cluster state moves back to `ACTIVE`.  	- This state rejects ALL operations immediately EXCEPT the read-only operations like `map.get()` and `cache.get()`, replication and cluster heartbeat tasks.  	- You cannot change the state of a cluster to `PASSIVE` when migration/replication tasks are being performed. 	- You can make use of `PASSIVE` state along with the [Hot Restart Persistence](#hot-restart-persistence) feature. Please see &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.java#L245\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Cluster Shutdown API&lt;/a&gt; for more info. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - **`IN_TRANSITION`**:  	- This state shows that the state of the cluster is in transition.  	- You cannot set your cluster's state as `IN_TRANSITION` explicitly.  	- It is a temporary and intermediate state.  	- During this state, your cluster does not accept new members and migration/replication tasks are paused.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *All in-cluster methods are fail-fast, i.e. when a method fails in the cluster, it throws an exception immediately (it will not be retried).*   The following snippet is from the `Cluster` interface showing the new methods used to manage your cluster's states.   ```java public interface Cluster { ... ...

A member can go into this state when either of the following happens: 	1. Until the member's shutdown process is completed after the method `Node.shutdown(boolean)` is called. Note that, when the shutdown process is completed, member's state changes to `SHUT_DOWN`.  	2. Cluster's state is changed to `PASSIVE` using the method `changeClusterState()`.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; - **`SHUT_DOWN`**: A member goes into this state when the member's shutdown process is completed.

The following are the commands you can use.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Getting the cluster state:**  To get the state of the cluster, use the following command:  ``` curl --data \&quot;${GROUPNAME}&amp;${PASSWORD}\&quot; http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/state ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Changing the cluster state:**  To change the state of the cluster to `frozen`, use the following command:  ``` curl --data \&quot;${GROUPNAME}&amp;${PASSWORD}&amp;${STATE}\&quot; http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/changeState  ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Shutting down the cluster:**  To shutdown the cluster, use the following command:  ``` curl --data \&quot;${GROUPNAME}&amp;${PASSWORD}\&quot;  http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/shutdown ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Partial starting the cluster:**  To partial start the cluster when Hot Restart is enabled, use the following command:  ``` curl --data \&quot;${GROUPNAME}&amp;${PASSWORD}\&quot; http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/partialStart/ ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; **Force starting the cluster:**  To force start the cluster when Hot Restart is enabled, use the following command:  ``` curl --data \&quot;${GROUPNAME}&amp;${PASSWORD}\&quot; http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/forceStart/ ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You can also perform the above operations using the Hot Restart tab of Hazelcast Management Center or using the script `cluster.sh`. Please see the [Hot Restart section](#hot-restart) and [Using the Script cluster.sh section](#using-the-script-cluster-sh).* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  **Querying the current cluster version:**  To get the current cluster version, use the following `curl` command:  ``` $ curl http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version   {\&quot;status\&quot;:\&quot;success\&quot;,\&quot;version\&quot;:\&quot;3.9\&quot;} ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  **Changing the cluster version:**  To upgrade the cluster version, after having upgraded all members of your cluster to a new minor version, use the following `curl` command:  ``` $ curl --data \&quot;${GROUPNAME}&amp;${PASSWORD}&amp;${CLUSTER_VERSION}\&quot; http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version  ```  For example, assuming the default group name and password, issue the following command to any member of the cluster to upgrade from cluster version 3.8 to 3.9:  ``` $ curl --data \&quot;dev&amp;dev-pass&amp;3.9\&quot; http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version   {\&quot;status\&quot;:\&quot;success\&quot;,\&quot;version\&quot;:\&quot;3.9\&quot;} ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You can also perform the above cluster version operations using Hazelcast Management Center or using the script `cluster.sh`.

You can use these member attributes to tag your members as your business logic requirements.  To define member attribute on a member, you can either:  - provide `MemberAttributeConfig` to your `Config` object,  - or provide member attributes at runtime via attribute setter methods on the `Member` interface.  For example, you can tag your members with their CPU characteristics and you can route CPU intensive tasks to those CPU-rich members.  ```java MemberAttributeConfig fourCore = new MemberAttributeConfig(); memberAttributeConfig.setIntAttribute( \&quot;CPU_CORE_COUNT\&quot;, 4 ); MemberAttributeConfig twelveCore = new MemberAttributeConfig(); memberAttributeConfig.setIntAttribute( \&quot;CPU_CORE_COUNT\&quot;, 12 ); MemberAttributeConfig twentyFourCore = new MemberAttributeConfig(); memberAttributeConfig.setIntAttribute( \&quot;CPU_CORE_COUNT\&quot;, 24 );  Config member1Config = new Config(); config.setMemberAttributeConfig( fourCore ); Config member2Config = new Config(); config.setMemberAttributeConfig( twelveCore ); Config member3Config = new Config(); config.setMemberAttributeConfig( twentyFourCore );  HazelcastInstance member1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member1Config ); HazelcastInstance member2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member2Config ); HazelcastInstance member3 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member3Config );  IExecutorService executorService = member1.getExecutorService( \&quot;processor\&quot; );  executorService.execute( new CPUIntensiveTask(), new MemberSelector() {   @Override   public boolean select(Member member) {     int coreCount = (int) member.getIntAttribute( \&quot;CPU_CORE_COUNT\&quot; );     // Task will be executed at either member2 or member3     if ( coreCount &gt; 8 ) {        return true;     }     return false;   } } );  HazelcastInstance member4 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); // We can also set member attributes at runtime. member4.setIntAttribute( \&quot;CPU_CORE_COUNT\&quot;, 2 ); ```  For another example, you can tag some members with a filter so that a member in the cluster can load classes from those tagged members. Please see the [User Code Deployment section](#user-code-deployment) for more information.  You can also configure your member attributes through declarative configuration and start your member afterwards. Here is how you can use the declarative approach:  ```xml &lt;member-attributes&gt;   &lt;attribute name=\&quot;CPU_CORE_COUNT\&quot;&gt;4&lt;/attribute-name&gt; &lt;/member-attributes&gt; ``` "

    body: "### Safety Checking Cluster Members  To prevent data loss when shutting down a cluster member, Hazelcast provides a graceful shutdown feature. You perform this shutdown by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.   Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, the master member migrates all of the replicas owned by the shutdown-requesting member to the other running (not initiated shutdown) cluster members. After these migrations are completed, the shutting down member will not be the owner or a backup of any partition anymore. It means that you can shutdown any number of Hazelcast members in a cluster concurrently with no data loss.  Please note that the process of shutting down members waits for a predefined amount of time for the master to migrate their partition replicas. You can specify this graceful shutdown timeout duration using the property `hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait`. Its default value is 10 minutes. If migrations are not completed within this duration, shutdown may continue non-gracefully and lead to data loss. Therefore, you should choose your own timeout duration considering the size of data in your cluster.  "

It returns `true` if there are no active partition migrations and all backups are in sync for each partition.  The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific member is in a safe state. It checks if all backups of partitions of the given member are in sync with the primary ones. Once it returns `true`, the given member is safe and it can be shut down without data loss.  Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member. The method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized, making the local member safe.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If you want to use the above methods, please note that they are available starting with Hazelcast 3.3.*  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *For more code samples please refer to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/monitoring/cluster/src/main/java\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;PartitionService Code Samples&lt;/a&gt;*. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; "

Every member will send to every other member, regardless if there is an operation running on behalf of that member, an operation heartbeat. It contains a listing of all `callId`s of the running operations from a given member. This plugin also works fine between members/lite-members.  Because this operation heartbeat is sent periodically; by default 1/4 of the operation call timeout of 60 seconds, we would expect an operation heartbeat to be received every 15 seconds. Operation heartbeats are high priority packets (so they overtake regular packets) and are processed by an isolated thread in the invocation monitor. If there is any deviation in the frequency of receiving these packets, it may be due to the problems such as network latencies.  The following shows an example of the output where an operation heartbeat has not been received for 37 seconds:  ``` 20-7-2017 11:12:55 OperationHeartbeats[                                   member[10.212.1.119]:5701[                                           deviation(%)=146.6666717529297                                           noHeartbeat(ms)=37,000                                           lastHeartbeat(ms)=1,500,538,375,603                                           lastHeartbeat(date-time)=20-7-2017 11:12:55                                           now(ms)=1,500,538,338,603                                           now(date-time)=20-7-2017 11:12:18]]] ```  The OperationHeartbeats plugin is enabled by default since it has very little overhead and will only print to the diagnostics file if the max-deviation (explained below) is exceeded.   You can control the OperationHeartbeats plugin using the following properties:  - `hazelcast.diagnostics.operation-heartbeat.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. It is configured to be 10 seconds by default. 0 disables the plugin. - `hazelcast.diagnostics.operation-heartbeat.max-deviation-percentage`:  The maximum allowed deviation percentage. Its default value is 33. For example, with a default 60 call timeout and operation heartbeat interval being 15 seconds, the maximum deviation with a deviation-percentage of 33, is 5 seconds. So there is no problem if a packet is arrived after 19 seconds, but if it arrives after 21 seconds, then the plugin will render.  "

The following shows an example of the output where no member/member heartbeat has been received for 9 seconds:  ``` 20-7-2017 19:32:22 MemberHeartbeats[                           member[10.212.1.119]:5701[                                   deviation(%)=80.0                                   noHeartbeat(ms)=9,000                                   lastHeartbeat(ms)=1,500,568,333,645                                   lastHeartbeat(date-time)=20-7-2017 19:32:13                                   now(ms)=1,500,568,342,645                                   now(date-time)=20-7-2017 19:32:22]] ```  The MemberHeartbeats plugin is enabled by default since it has very little overhead and will only print to the diagnostics file if the max-deviation (explained below) is exceeded.   You can control the MemberHeartbeats plugin using the following properties:  - `hazelcast.diagnostics.member-heartbeat.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. It is configured to be 10 seconds by default. 0 disables the plugin. - `hazelcast.diagnostics.member-heartbeat.max-deviation-percentage`:  The maximum allowed deviation percentage. Its default value is 100.  For example, if the interval of member/member heartbeats is 5 seconds, a 100% deviation will be fine with heartbeats arriving up to 5 seconds after they are expected. So a heartbeat arriving after 9 seconds will not be rendered, but a heartbeat received after 11 seconds will be rendered.

This allow you to add custom hooks to join and perform connection procedures (like identity checking using Kerberos, etc.).   To use the socket interceptor, implement `com.hazelcast.nio.MemberSocketInterceptor` for members and `com.hazelcast.nio.SocketInterceptor` for clients.  The following example code enables the socket interceptor for members.  ```java public class MySocketInterceptor implements MemberSocketInterceptor {   public void init( SocketInterceptorConfig socketInterceptorConfig ) {     // initialize interceptor   }    void onConnect( Socket connectedSocket ) throws IOException {     // do something meaningful when a member has connected to the cluster   }    public void onAccept( Socket acceptedSocket ) throws IOException {     // do something meaningful when the cluster is ready to accept the member connection   } } ```  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;network&gt;     ...     &lt;socket-interceptor enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;       &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.examples.MySocketInterceptor&lt;/class-name&gt;       &lt;properties&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;kerberos-host\&quot;&gt;kerb-host-name&lt;/property&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;kerberos-config-file\&quot;&gt;kerb.conf&lt;/property&gt;       &lt;/properties&gt;     &lt;/socket-interceptor&gt;   &lt;/network&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  ```java public class MyClientSocketInterceptor implements SocketInterceptor {   void onConnect( Socket connectedSocket ) throws IOException {     // do something meaningful when connected   } }  ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.setGroupConfig( new GroupConfig( \&quot;dev\&quot;, \&quot;dev-pass\&quot; ) )     .addAddress( \&quot;10.10.3.4\&quot; );  MyClientSocketInterceptor clientSocketInterceptor = new MyClientSocketInterceptor(); clientConfig.setSocketInterceptor( clientSocketInterceptor ); HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig ); ```   "

This lets you add a very flexible custom security logic. To do this, implement `com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptor`.  ```java public class MySecurityInterceptor implements SecurityInterceptor {    public void before( Credentials credentials, String serviceName,                       String methodName, Parameters parameters )       throws AccessControlException {     // credentials: client credentials      // serviceName: MapService.SERVICE_NAME, QueueService.SERVICE_NAME, ... etc     // methodName: put, get, offer, poll, ... etc     // parameters: holds parameters of the executed method, iterable.   }    public void after( Credentials credentials, String serviceName,                      String methodName, Parameters parameters ) {     // can be used for logging etc.   } } ```  The `before` method will be called before processing the request on the remote server. The `after` method will be called after the processing. Exceptions thrown while executing the `before` method will propagate to the client, but exceptions thrown while executing the `after` method will be suppressed.   "

Encryption is based on &lt;a href=\&quot;http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Java Cryptography Architecture&lt;/a&gt;.   Hazelcast provides symmetric and asymmetric encryption. For asymmetric encryption, SSL/TLS cryptographic protocols are used. For symmetric encryption, the following algorithms are used.  * DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding * PBEWithMD5AndDES * Blowfish * DESede  Hazelcast uses MD5 message-digest algorithm as the cryptographic hash function. You can also use the salting process by giving a salt and password which are then concatenated and processed with MD5, and the resulting output is stored with the salt.   In symmetric encryption, each member uses the same key, so the key is shared. Here is an example configuration for symmetric encryption.   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;network&gt;     ...     &lt;symmetric-encryption enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;       &lt;algorithm&gt;PBEWithMD5AndDES&lt;/algorithm&gt;       &lt;salt&gt;thesalt&lt;/salt&gt;       &lt;password&gt;thepass&lt;/password&gt;       &lt;iteration-count&gt;19&lt;/iteration-count&gt;     &lt;/symmetric-encryption&gt;   &lt;/network&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  You set the encryption algorithm, the salt value to use for generating the secret key, the password to use when generating the secret key, and the iteration count to use when generating the secret key. You also need to set `enabled` to true. Note that all members should have the same encryption configuration.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg)***NOTE:*** *Encryption cannot be used on Hazelcast clients.

To use it, you need to implement `com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.SSLContextFactory` and configure the SSL section in the network configuration.  The following is the implementation code snippet:  ```java public class MySSLContextFactory implements SSLContextFactory {   public void init( Properties properties ) throws Exception {   }    public SSLContext getSSLContext() {     ...

    title: "TLS/SSL Performance Improvements for Java",
    body: "### TLS/SSL Performance Improvements for Java  TLS/SSL can have a significant impact on performance. There are a few ways to increase the performance.   The first thing that can be done is making sure that AES intrensics are used. Modern CPUs (2010 or newer Westmere) have hardware support for AES encryption/decryption and if a Java 8 or newer JVM is used, the JIT will automatically make use of these AES instructions. They can also be explicitly enabled using `-XX:+UseAES -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics`,  or disabled using `-XX:-UseAES -XX:-UseAESIntrinsics`.   A lot of encryption algorithms make use of padding because they encrypt/decrypt in fixed sized blocks. If not enough data is available  for a block, the algorithm relies on random number generation to pad. Under Linux, the JVM automatically makes use of `/dev/random` for  the generation of random numbers. `/dev/random` relies on entropy to be able to generate random numbers. However if this entropy is  insufficient to keep up with the rate requiring random numbers, it can slow down the encryption/decryption since `/dev/random` will block; it could block for minutes waiting for sufficient entropy . This can be fixed by adding the following system property `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom`. For a more permanent solution, modify  `&lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;/jre/lib/security/java.security` file, look for the `securerandom.source=/dev/urandom` and change it  to `securerandom.source=file:/dev/./urandom`. Switching to `/dev/urandom` could be controversial because the `/dev/urandom` will not  block if there is a shortage of entropy and the returned random values could theoretically be vulnerable to a cryptographic attack.  If this is a concern in your application, use `/dev/random` instead.  Another way to increase performance for the Java smart client is to make use of Hazelcast 3.8. In Hazelcast 3.8, the Java smart client  automatically makes use of extra I/O threads for encryption/decryption and this have a significant impact on the performance. This can be changed using the `hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count` and `hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count` client system properties. By default it is 1 input thread and 1 output thread. If TLS/SSL is enabled, it will default to 3 input threads and 3 output threads. Having more client I/O threads than members in the cluster will not lead to an increased performance. So with a 2-member cluster, 2 in and 2 out threads will give the best performance.  "

The cipher suites are configured using the `ciphersuites` property as shown below:  ```xml &lt;ssl enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;     &lt;factory-class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.OpenSSLEngineFactory&lt;/factory-class-name&gt;           &lt;properties&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;keyStore\&quot;&gt;upload/hazelcast.keystore&lt;/property&gt;         ...         ...         ...         &lt;property name=\&quot;ciphersuites\&quot;&gt;TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,                                       TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA&lt;/property&gt;     &lt;/properties&gt; &lt;/ssl&gt; ```  The `ciphersuites` property accepts a comma separated list (spaces, enters, tabs are filtered out) of cipher suites in the order  of preference.  You can configure a member and client with different cipher suites; but there should be at least one shared cipher suite.   One of the cipher suites that gave very low overhead but still provides solid security is the 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'. However in our measurements this cipher suite only performs well using OpenSSL; using the regular Java TLS integration, it performs badly. So keep that in mind when configuring a client using regular SSL and a member using OpenSSL.  Please check with your security expert to determine which cipher suites are appropriate and run performance tests to see which ones perform well in your environment.  If you don't configure the cipher suites, then both client and/or member will determine a cipher suite by themselves during the TLS/SSL  handshake. This can lead to suboptimal performance and lower security than required.  "

Credentials is an interface which extends `Serializable`. You can either implement the three methods in the `Credentials` interface, or you can extend the `AbstractCredentials` class, which is an abstract implementation of `Credentials`.  Hazelcast calls the `Credentials.setEndpoint()` method when an authentication request arrives at the member before authentication takes place.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; public interface Credentials extends Serializable {   String getEndpoint();   void setEndpoint( String endpoint ) ;       String getPrincipal() ;     } ```  Here is an example of extending the `AbstractCredentials` class.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; ... public abstract class AbstractCredentials implements Credentials, DataSerializable {   private transient String endpoint;   private String principal;   ... } ```  `UsernamePasswordCredentials`, a custom implementation of Credentials, is in the Hazelcast `com.hazelcast.security` package. `UsernamePasswordCredentials` is used for default configuration during the authentication process of both members and clients.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; ... public class UsernamePasswordCredentials extends Credentials {   private byte[] password;   ... } ``` "

To access the `Credentials` object, Hazelcast uses its own specialized `CallbackHandler`. During initialization of `LoginModules`, Hazelcast passes this special `CallbackHandler` into the `LoginModule.initialize()` method.  Your implementation of `LoginModule` should create an instance of `com.hazelcast.security.CredentialsCallback` and call the `handle(Callback[] callbacks)` method of `CallbackHandler` during the login process.   `CredentialsCallback.getCredentials()` returns the supplied `Credentials` object.  ```java public class CustomLoginModule implements LoginModule {   CallbackHandler callbackHandler;   Subject subject;   Credentials credentials;        public void initialize( Subject subject, CallbackHandler callbackHandler,                           Map&lt;String, ?&gt; sharedState, Map&lt;String, ?&gt; options ) {     this.subject = subject;     this.callbackHandler = callbackHandler;   }    public final boolean login() throws LoginException {     CredentialsCallback callback = new CredentialsCallback();     try {       callbackHandler.handle( new Callback[] { callback } );       credentials = callback.getCredentials();     } catch ( Exception e ) {       throw new LoginException( e.getMessage() );     }     ...   }   ... } ```  To use the default Hazelcast permission policy, you must create an instance of `com.hazelcast.security.ClusterPrincipal` that holds the `Credentials` object, and you must add it to `Subject.principals onLoginModule.commit()` as shown below.  ```java public class MyCustomLoginModule implements LoginModule {   ...   public boolean commit() throws LoginException {     ...     Principal principal = new ClusterPrincipal( credentials );     subject.getPrincipals().add( principal );              return true;   }   ... } ```  Hazelcast has an abstract implementation of `LoginModule` that does callback and cleanup operations and holds the resulting `Credentials` instance. `LoginModule`s extending `ClusterLoginModule` can access `Credentials`, `Subject`, `LoginModule` instances and options, and `sharedState` maps. Extending the `ClusterLoginModule` is recommended instead of implementing all required stuff.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; ... public abstract class ClusterLoginModule implements LoginModule {    protected abstract boolean onLogin() throws LoginException;   protected abstract boolean onCommit() throws LoginException;   protected abstract boolean onAbort() throws LoginException;   protected abstract boolean onLogout() throws LoginException; } ``` &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

The `IPermissionPolicy.getPermissions(Subject subject, Class&lt;? extends Permission&gt; type)` method is used to determine a client request that has been granted permission to perform a security-sensitive operation.   Permission policy should return a `PermissionCollection` containing permissions of the given type for the given `Subject`. The Hazelcast access controller will call `PermissionCollection.implies(Permission)` on returning `PermissionCollection` and it will decide whether or not the current `Subject` has permission to access the requested resources.

The following operations will be routed to the same member, since all of them are operating based on the same key `\&quot;key1\&quot;`.  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map mapA = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mapA\&quot; ); Map mapB = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mapB\&quot; ); Map mapC = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mapC\&quot; );  // since map names are different, operation will be manipulating // different entries, but the operation will take place on the // same member since the keys (\&quot;key1\&quot;) are the same mapA.put( \&quot;key1\&quot;, value ); mapB.get( \&quot;key1\&quot; ); mapC.remove( \&quot;key1\&quot; );  // lock operation will still execute on the same member // of the cluster since the key (\&quot;key1\&quot;) is same hazelcastInstance.getLock( \&quot;key1\&quot; ).lock();  // distributed execution will execute the 'runnable' on the // same member since \&quot;key1\&quot; is passed as the key.    hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService().executeOnKeyOwner( runnable, \&quot;key1\&quot; ); ```  When the keys are the same, entries are stored on the same member. But we sometimes want to have related entries stored on the same member, such as a customer and his/her order entries. We would have a customers map with customerId as the key and an orders map with orderId as the key. Since customerId and orderId are different keys, a customer and his/her orders may fall into different members in your cluster. So how can we have them stored on the same member? We create an affinity between customer and orders. If we make them part of the same partition then these entries will be co-located. We achieve this by making orderIds `PartitionAware`.  ```java public class OrderKey implements Serializable, PartitionAware {    private final long customerId;   private final long orderId;    public OrderKey( long orderId, long customerId ) {     this.customerId = customerId;     this.orderId = orderId;   }    public long getCustomerId() {     return customerId;   }    public long getOrderId() {     return orderId;   }    public Object getPartitionKey() {     return customerId;   }    @Override   public String toString() {     return \&quot;OrderKey{\&quot;       + \&quot;customerId=\&quot; + customerId       + \&quot;, orderId=\&quot; + orderId       + '}';   } } ```  Notice that OrderKey implements `PartitionAware` and that `getPartitionKey()` returns the `customerId`. This will make sure that the `Customer` entry and its `Order`s will be stored on the same member.  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map mapCustomers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); Map mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;orders\&quot; );  // create the customer entry with customer id = 1 mapCustomers.put( 1, customer );  // now create the orders for this customer mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 21, 1 ), order ); mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 22, 1 ), order ); mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 23, 1 ), order ); ```  Assume that you have a customers map where `customerId` is the key and the customer object is the value. You want to remove one of the customer orders and return the number of remaining orders. Here is how you would normally do it.  ```java public static int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception {   IMap&lt;Long, Customer&gt; mapCustomers = instance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );   IMap mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;orders\&quot; );    mapCustomers.lock( customerId );   mapOrders.remove( orderId );   Set orders = orderMap.keySet(Predicates.equal( \&quot;customerId\&quot;, customerId ));   mapCustomers.unlock( customerId );    return orders.size(); } ```  There are couple of things you should consider.  1. There are four distributed operations there: lock, remove, keySet, unlock. Can you reduce  the number of distributed operations? 2. The customer object may not be that big, but can you not have to pass that object through the  wire? Think about a scenario where you set order count to the customer object for fast access, so you  should do a get and a put, and as a result, the customer object is passed through the wire twice.  Instead, why not move the computation over to the member (JVM) where your customer data resides. Here is how you can do this with distributed executor service.  1. Send a `PartitionAware` `Callable` task. 2. `Callable` does the deletion of the order right there and returns with the remaining  order count. 3. Upon completion of the `Callable` task, return the result (remaining order count). You  do not have to wait until the task is completed; since distributed executions are asynchronous, you can do other things in the meantime.  Here is an example code.  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();      public int removeOrder(long customerId, long orderId) throws Exception {         IExecutorService executorService = hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService(\&quot;ExecutorService\&quot;);          OrderDeletionTask task = new OrderDeletionTask(customerId, orderId);         Future&lt;Integer&gt; future = executorService.submit(task);         int remainingOrders = future.get();          return remainingOrders;     }      public static class OrderDeletionTask             implements Callable&lt;Integer&gt;, PartitionAware, Serializable, HazelcastInstanceAware {          private long orderId;         private long customerId;         private HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;          public OrderDeletionTask() {         }          public OrderDeletionTask(long customerId, long orderId) {             this.customerId = customerId;             this.orderId = orderId;         }          @Override         public Integer call() {             IMap&lt;Long, Customer&gt; customerMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap(\&quot;customers\&quot;);             IMap&lt;OrderKey, Order&gt; orderMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap(\&quot;orders\&quot;);              customerMap.lock(customerId);              Predicate predicate = Predicates.equal(\&quot;customerId\&quot;, customerId);             Set&lt;OrderKey&gt; orderKeys = orderMap.localKeySet(predicate);             int orderCount = orderKeys.size();             for (OrderKey key : orderKeys) {                 if (key.orderId == orderId) {                     orderCount--;                     orderMap.delete(key);                 }             }              customerMap.unlock(customerId);              return orderCount;         }          @Override         public Object getPartitionKey() {             return customerId;         }          @Override         public void setHazelcastInstance(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {             this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;         }     } ```  The benefits of doing the same operation with distributed `ExecutorService` based on the key are:  - Only one distributed execution (`executorService.submit(task)`), instead of four. - Less data is sent over the wire. - Since lock/update/unlock cycle is done locally (local to the customer data), lock duration for the `Customer` entry is much less, thus enabling higher concurrency.

    title: "PartitioningStrategy",
    body: "#### PartitioningStrategy  Another way of storing the related data on the same location is using/implementing the class `PartitioningStrategy`. Normally (if no partitioning strategy is defined), Hazelcast finds the partition of a key first by converting the object to binary and then by hashing this binary. If a partitioning strategy is defined, Hazelcast injects the key to the strategy and the strategy returns an object out of which the partition is calculated by hashing it.  Hazelcast offers the following out-of-the-box partitioning strategies:  - `DefaultPartitioningStrategy`: Default strategy. It checks whether the key implements `PartitionAware`. If it implements, the object is converted to binary and then hashed, to find the partition of the key. - `StringPartitioningStrategy`: Works only for string keys. It uses the string after `@` character as the partition ID. For example, if you have two keys `ordergroup1@region1` and `customergroup1@region1`, both `ordergroup1` and `customergroup1` will fall into the partition where `region1` is located. - `StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy`: Works as the combination of the above two strategies. If the key implements `PartitionAware`, it works like the `DefaultPartitioningStrategy`. If it is a string key, it works like the `StringPartitioningStrategy`.  Following are the example configuration snippets. Note that these strategy configurations are **per map**.   **Declarative Configuration**   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt; ...    &lt;map name=\&quot;name-of-the-map\&quot;&gt;    ...       &lt;partition-strategy&gt;          com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy       &lt;/partition-strategy&gt;    ...    &lt;/map&gt; ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  **Programmatic Configuration**  ```java Config config = new Config(); MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig(\&quot;name-of-the-map\&quot;); PartitioningStrategyConfig psConfig = mapConfig.getPartitioningStrategyConfig(); psConfig.setPartitioningStrategyClass( \&quot;StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy\&quot; );  // OR psConfig.setPartitioningStrategy(YourCustomPartitioningStrategy); ... ```    You can also define your own partition strategy by implementing the class `PartitioningStrategy`. To enable your implementation, add the full class name to your Hazelcast configuration using either the declarative or programmatic approach, as sampled above.  As stated previously, above strategies are defined **per map** in your Hazelcast member. You can also define a strategy **per member** in your Hazelcast cluster. This can be done by defining the `hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class` system property. An example declarative way of configuring this property is shown below:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt; ...   &lt;properties&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class\&quot;&gt;        com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy     &lt;/property&gt;     ....   &lt;/properties&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  You can also use other system property configuring options as explained in the [Configuring with System Properties section](#configuring-with-system-properties).

    body: "## Back Pressure  Hazelcast uses operations to make remote calls. For example, a `map.get` is an operation and a `map.put` is one operation for the primary  and one operation for each of the backups, i.e. `map.put` is executed for the primary and also for each backup. In most cases, there will be a natural balance between the number of threads performing operations and the number of operations being executed. However, there are two situations where this balance and operations  can pile up and eventually lead to Out of Memory Exception (OOME):  - Asynchronous calls: With async calls, the system may be flooded with the requests.  - Asynchronous backups: The asynchronous backups may be piling up.  To prevent the system from crashing, Hazelcast provides back pressure. Back pressure works by:   - limiting the number of concurrent operation invocations,   - periodically making an async backup sync.  "

Using a default configuration a system is allowed to have (271 + 1) * 100 = 27200 concurrent invocations (271 partitions + 1 for generic operations).   Back pressure is only applied to normal operations. System operations like heart beats and partition migration operations  are not influenced by back pressure. 27200 invocations might seem like a lot, but keep in mind that executing a task on `IExecutor`  or acquiring a lock also requires an operation.  If the maximum number of invocations has been reached, Hazelcast will automatically apply an exponential back off policy. This gives the system some time to deal with the load. Using the following system property, you can configure the maximum time to wait before a `HazelcastOverloadException` is thrown:  `hazelcast.backpressure.backoff.timeout.millis`  This system property's default value is 60000 ms.  The Health Monitor keeps an eye on the usage of the invocations. If it sees a member has consumed 70% or more of the invocations, it starts to log health messages.  Apart from controlling the number of invocations, you also need to control the number of pending async backups. This is done by periodically making these backups sync instead of async. This forces all pending backups to get drained. For this, Hazelcast tracks the number of asynchronous backups for each partition. At every **Nth** call, one synchronization is forced. This **N** is  controlled through the following property:  `hazelcast.backpressure.syncwindow`  This system property's default value is 100. It means, out of 100 *asynchronous* backups, Hazelcast makes 1 of them a *synchronous* one. A randomization is added, so the sync window with default configuration will be between 75 and 125  invocations.   "

On each cluster member, the I/O threading is split up in 3 types of I/O threads:  * I/O thread for the accept requests. * I/O threads to read data from other members/clients. * I/O threads to write data to other members/clients.  You can configure the number of I/O threads using the `hazelcast.io.thread.count` system property. Its default value is 3 per member. If 3 is used, in total there are 7 I/O threads: 1 accept I/O thread, 3 read I/O threads, and 3 write I/O threads. Each I/O thread has its own Selector instance and waits on the `Selector.select` if there is nothing to do.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You can also specify counts for input and output threads separately. There are `hazelcast.io.input.thread.count` and `hazelcast.io.output.thread.count` properties for this purpose. Please refer to the [System Properties section](#system-properties) for information on these properties and how to set them.*   Hazelcast periodically scans utilization of each I/O thread and can decide to migrate a connection to a new thread if the existing thread is servicing a disproportionate number of I/O events. You can customize the scanning interval by configuring the `hazelcast.io.balancer.interval.seconds` system property; its default interval is 20 seconds. You can disable the balancing process by setting this property to a negative value.  In case of the read I/O thread, when sufficient bytes for a packet have been received, the `Packet` object is created. This `Packet` object is  then sent to the system where it is de-multiplexed.

    body: "### Event Threading  Hazelcast uses a shared event system to deal with components that rely on events, such as topic, collections, listeners, and Near Cache.   Each cluster member has an array of event threads and each thread has its own work queue. When an event is produced, either locally or remotely, an event thread is selected (depending on if there is a message ordering) and the event is placed in the work queue for that event thread.  The following properties can be set to alter the behavior of the system.  * `hazelcast.event.thread.count`: Number of event-threads in this array. Its default value is 5. * `hazelcast.event.queue.capacity`: Capacity of the work queue. Its default value is 1000000. * `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis`: Timeout for placing an item on the work queue. Its default value is 250.  If you process a lot of events and have many cores, changing the value of `hazelcast.event.thread.count` property to a higher value is a good practice. This way, more events can be processed in parallel.  Multiple components share the same event queues. If there are 2 topics, say A and B, for certain messages they may share the same queue(s) and hence the same event thread. If there are a lot of pending messages produced by A, then B needs to wait. Also, when processing a message from A takes a lot of time and the event thread is used for that, B suffers from this.  That is why it is better to offload processing to a dedicated thread (pool) so that systems are better isolated.  If the events are produced at a higher rate than they are consumed, the queue grows in size. To prevent overloading the system and running into an `OutOfMemoryException`, the queue is given a capacity of 1 million items. When the maximum capacity is reached, the items are dropped. This means that the event system is a 'best effort' system. There is no guarantee that you are going to get an event. Topic A might have a lot of pending messages and therefore B cannot receive messages because the queue has no capacity and messages for B are dropped.  "

The default value of this array's size is the number of cores and it has a minimum value of 2. This value can be changed using the `hazelcast.operation.thread.count` property.  Each operation thread has its own work queue and it consumes messages from this work queue. If a partition-aware  operation needs to be scheduled, the right thread is found using the formula below.  `threadIndex = partitionId % partition thread-count`  After the `threadIndex` is determined, the operation is put in the work queue of that operation thread. This means the followings:   * A single operation thread executes operations for multiple partitions; if there are 271 partitions and  10 partition threads, then roughly every operation thread executes operations for 27 partitions.    * Each partition belongs to only 1 operation thread. All operations for a partition are always handled by exactly the same operation thread.    * Concurrency control is not needed to deal with partition-aware operations because once a partition-aware  operation is put in the work queue of a partition-aware operation thread, only   1 thread is able to touch that partition.  Because of this threading strategy, there are two forms of false sharing you need to be aware of:  * False sharing of the partition - two completely independent data structures share the same partition. For example, if there  is a map `employees` and a map `orders`, the method `employees.get(\&quot;peter\&quot;)` running on partition 25 may be blocked  by the method `orders.get(1234)` also running on partition 25. If independent data structures share the same partition,  a slow operation on one data structure can slow down the other data structures.   * False sharing of the partition-aware operation thread - each operation thread is responsible for executing  operations on a number of partitions. For example, *thread 1* could be responsible for partitions 0, 10, 20, etc. and *thread-2* could be responsible for partitions  1, 11, 21, etc. If an operation for partition 1 takes a lot of time, it blocks the execution of an operation for partition  11 because both of them are mapped to the same operation thread.  You need to be careful with long running operations because you could starve operations of a thread.  As a general rule, the partition thread should be released as soon as possible because operations are not designed as long running operations. That is why, for example, it is very dangerous to execute a long running operation  using `AtomicReference.alter()` or an `IMap.executeOnKey()`, because these operations block other operations to be executed.  Currently, there is no support for work stealing. Different partitions that map to the same thread may need to wait  till one of the partitions is finished, even though there are other free partition-aware operation threads available.  **Example:**  Take a cluster with three members. Two members will have 90 primary partitions and one member will have 91 primary partitions. Let's say you have one CPU and four cores per CPU. By default, four operation threads will be allocated to serve 90 or 91 partitions.  "

It can be changed using the  `hazelcast.operation.generic.thread.count` property.   A non-partition-aware operation thread does not execute an operation for a specific partition. Only partition-aware   operation threads execute partition-aware operations.   Unlike the partition-aware operation threads, all the generic operation threads share the same work queue: `genericWorkQueue`.  If a non-partition-aware operation needs to be executed, it is placed in that work queue and any generic operation  thread can execute it. The big advantage is that you automatically have work balancing since any generic operation  thread is allowed to pick up work from this queue.

The partition thread always checks the priority queue before it processes work from its normal work queue.  * For non-partition-aware operations: Next to the `genericWorkQueue`, there is also a `genericPriorityWorkQueue`.

    title: "Near Cache",
    body: "## Near Cache  Map or Cache entries in Hazelcast are partitioned across the cluster members. Hazelcast clients do not have local data at all. Suppose you read the key `k` a number of times from a Hazelcast client or `k` is owned by another member in your cluster. Then each `map.get(k)` or `cache.get(k)` will be a remote operation, which creates a lot of network trips. If you have a data structure that is mostly read, then you should consider creating a local Near Cache, so that reads are sped up and less network traffic is created.   These benefits do not come for free, please consider the following trade-offs:  - Members with a Near Cache will have to hold the extra cached data, which increases memory consumption. - If invalidation is enabled and entries are updated frequently, then invalidations will be costly. - Near Cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be reading stale data.  Near Cache is highly recommended for data structures that are mostly read.  In a client/server system you must enable the Near Cache separately on the client, without the need to configure it on the server. Please note that Near Cache configuration is specific to the server or client itself: a data structure on a server may not have Near Cache configured while the same data structure on a client may have Near Cache configured. They also can have different Near Cache configurations.  If you are using Near Cache, you should take into account that your hits to the keys in the Near Cache are not reflected as hits to the original keys on the primary members. This has for example an impact on IMap's maximum idle seconds or time-to-live seconds expiration. Therefore, even though there is a hit on a key in Near Cache, your original key on the primary member may expire.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Near Cache works only when you access data via `map.get(k)` or `cache.get(k)` methods. Data returned using a predicate is not stored in the Near Cache.*  "

Following are the descriptions of all configuration elements:  - `in-memory-format`: Specifies in which format data will be stored in your Near Cache. Note that a map's in-memory format can be different from that of its Near Cache. Available values are as follows:   - `BINARY`: Data will be stored in serialized binary format (default value).   - `OBJECT`: Data will be stored in deserialized form.   - `NATIVE`: Data will be stored in the Near Cache that uses Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store feature. This option is available only in Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD. Note that a map and its Near Cache can independently use High-Density Memory Store. For example, while your map does not use High-Density Memory Store, its Near Cache can use it. - `serialize-keys`: Specifies if the keys of a Near Cache entry should be serialized or not. Serializing the keys has a big impact on the read performance of the Near Cache. It should just be activated when you have mutable keys, which are changed after use for the Near Cache. Its default value is `false`. - `invalidate-on-change`: Specifies whether the cached entries are evicted when the entries are updated or removed. Its default value is true. - `time-to-live-seconds`: Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the Near Cache. Entries that are older than this period are automatically evicted from the Near Cache. Regardless of the eviction policy used, `time-to-live-seconds` still applies. Any integer between 0 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. 0 means infinite. Its default value is 0. - `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the Near Cache as untouched (not read). Entries that are not read more than this period are removed from the Near Cache. Any integer between 0 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. 0 means `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Its default value is 0. - `eviction`: Specifies the eviction behavior when you use High-Density Memory Store for your Near Cache. It has the following attributes:   - `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy configuration. Available values are as follows: 	* `LRU`: Least Recently Used (default value). 	* `LFU`: Least Frequently Used. 	* `NONE`: No items will be evicted and the property max-size will be ignored. You still can combine it with `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds` to evict items from the Near Cache. 	- `RANDOM`: A random item will be evicted.   - `max-size-policy`: Maximum size policy for eviction of the Near Cache. Available values are as follows: 	* `ENTRY_COUNT`: Maximum size based on the entry count in the Near Cache (default value). 	* `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: Maximum used native memory size of the specified Near Cache in MB to trigger the eviction. If the used native memory size exceeds this threshold, the eviction is triggered.  Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. 	* `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: Maximum used native memory percentage of the specified Near Cache to trigger the eviction. If the native memory usage percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) exceeds this threshold, the eviction is triggered. Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. 	* `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: Minimum free native memory size of the specified Near Cache in MB to trigger the eviction. If free native memory size goes below this threshold, eviction is triggered. Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. 	* `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: Minimum free native memory percentage of the specified Near Cache to trigger eviction. If free native memory percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) goes below this threshold, eviction is triggered. Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.   - `size`: Maximum size of the Near Cache used for `max-size-policy`. When this is reached the Near Cache is evicted based on the policy defined. Any integer between `1` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This value has different defaults, depending on the data structure. 	* `IMap`: Its default value is `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for on-heap maps and `10000` for the `NATIVE` in-memory format. 	* `JCache`: Its default value is `10000`. - `cache-local-entries`: Specifies whether the local entries will be cached. It can be useful when in-memory format for Near Cache is different from that of the map. By default, it is disabled. Is just available on Hazelcast members, not on Hazelcast clients (which have no local entries). - `local-update-policy`: Specifies the update policy of the local Near Cache. It is available on JCache clients. Available values are as follows:    - `INVALIDATE`: Removes the Near Cache entry on mutation. After the mutative call to the member completes but before the operation returns to the caller, the Near Cache entry is removed. Until the mutative operation completes, the readers still continue to read the old value. But as soon as the update completes the Near Cache entry is removed. Any threads reading the key after this point will have a Near Cache miss and call through to the member, obtaining the new entry. This setting provides read-your-writes consistency. This is the default setting.    - `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`: Updates the Near Cache entry on mutation. After the mutative call to the member completes but before the put returns to the caller, the Near Cache entry is updated. So a remove will remove it and one of the put methods will update it to the new value. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache. But before the call completes the Near Cache entry is updated. Any threads reading the key after this point will read the new entry. If the mutative operation was a remove, the key will no longer exist in the cache, both the Near Cache and the original copy in the member. The member will initiate an invalidate event to any other Near Caches, however the caller Near Cache is not invalidated as it already has the new value. This setting also provides read-your-writes consistency. - `preloader`: Specifies if the Near Cache should store and pre-load its keys for a faster re-population after a Hazelcast client restart. Is just available on IMap and JCache clients. It has the following attributes:   - `enabled`: Specifies whether the preloader for this Near Cache is enabled or not, `true` or `false`.   - `directory`: Specifies the parent directory for the preloader of this Near Cache. The filenames for the preloader storage will be generated from the Near Cache name. You can additionally specify the parent directory to have multiple clients on the same machine with the same Near Cache names.   - `store-initial-delay-seconds`: Specifies the delay in seconds until the keys of this Near Cache are stored for the first time. Its default value is `600`.   - `store-interval-seconds`: Specifies the interval in seconds in which the keys of this Near Cache are stored. Its default value is `600`.   "

You can use wildcards, so in this example `mostlyRead*` would also match the map `mostlyReadMap`.

    body: "### Near Cache Invalidation  Invalidation is the process of removing an entry from the Near Cache when its value is updated or it is removed from the original data structure (to prevent stale reads). Near Cache invalidation happens asynchronously at the cluster level, but synchronously at the current member. This means that the Near Cache is invalidated within the whole cluster after the modifying operation is finished, but updated from the current member before the modifying operation is done. A modifying operation can be an EntryProcessor, an explicit update or remove as well as an expiration or eviction. Generally, whenever the state of an entry changes in the record store by updating its value or removing it, the invalidation event is sent for that entry.  Invalidations can be sent from members to client Near Caches or to member Near Caches, either individually or in batches. Default behavior is sending in batches. If there are lots of mutating operations such as put/remove on data structures, it is advised that you configure batch invalidations. This reduces the network traffic and keeps the eventing system less busy, but may increase the delay of individual invalidations.  You can use the following system properties to configure the Near Cache invalidation:  - `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.enabled`: Enable or disable batching. Default value is `true`. When it is set to `false`, all invalidations are sent immediately. - `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.size`: Maximum number of invalidations in a batch. Default value is `100`. - `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batchfrequency.seconds`: If the collected invalidations do not reach the configured batch size, a background process sends them periodically. The default value is `10` seconds.  If there are a lot of clients or many mutating operations, batching should remain enabled and the batch size should be configured with the `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.size` system property to a suitable value.

If an event is lost, reads from Near Cache can indefinitely be stale.  To solve this problem, starting with Hazelcast 3.8, Hazelcast provides eventually consistent behavior for IMap/JCache Near Caches by detecting invalidation losses. After detection of an invalidation loss, stale data will be made unreachable and Near Cache's `get` calls to that data will be directed to underlying IMap/JCache to fetch the fresh data.  You can configure eventual consistency with the system properties below (same properties are valid for both member and client side Near Caches):  - `hazelcast.invalidation.max.tolerated.miss.count`: Default value is 10. If missed invalidation count is bigger than this value, relevant cached data will be made unreachable.  - `hazelcast.invalidation.reconciliation.interval.seconds`: Default value is 60 seconds. This is a periodic task that scans cluster members periodically to compare generated invalidation events with the received ones from Near Cache.  "

To achieve this consistency, Near Cache configuration provides two update policies:  - `INVALIDATE` - `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`  If you choose `INVALIDATE`, the entry is removed from the Near Cache after the update/remove occurs in the underlying data structure, and before the operation (get) returns to the caller. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache.  If you choose `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`, the entry is updated after the update/remove occurs in the underlying data structure and before the operation (put/get) returns to the caller. If it is an update operation, it will remove the entry and the new value will be placed. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache.

    body: "### Near Cache Preloader  The Near Cache preloader is a functionality to store the keys from a Near Cache to provide a fast re-population of the previous hot data set after a Hazelcast Client has been restarted. It is available on IMap and JCache clients.  The Near Cache preloader stores the keys (not the values) of Near Cache entries in regular intervals. You can define the initial delay via `store-initial-delay-seconds`, e.g., if you know that your hot data set will need some time to build up. You can configure the interval via `store-interval-seconds` which determines how often the key-set will be stored. The persistence will not run continuously. Whenever the storage is scheduled, it will be performed on the actual keys in the Near Cache.   The Near Cache preloader will be triggered on the first initialization of the data structure on the client, e.g., `client.getMap(\&quot;myNearCacheMap\&quot;)`. This schedules the preloader, which will work in the background, so your application is not blocked. The storage will be enabled after the loading is completed.  The configuration parameter `directory` is optional. If you omit it the base folder will be the user working directory (normally where the JVM was started or configured with the system property `user.dir`). The storage filenames will always be created from the Near Cache name. So even if you use a wildcard name in the Near Cache Configuration, the preloader filenames will be unique.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If you run multiple Hazelcast clients with enabled Near Cache preloader on the same machine, you have to configure a unique storage filename for each client or run them from different user directories. If two clients would write into the same file, only the first client will succeed. The following clients will throw an exception as soon as the Near Cache preloader is triggered.* "

Every cluster would be operating at native speed in their own LAN (Local Area Network), but you also want some or all record sets in these clusters to be replicated to each other: updates in the Tokyo cluster should also replicate to London and New York and updates in the New York cluster are to be synchronized to the Tokyo and London clusters.

This name is referenced in IMap or ICache configuration when you add WAN Replication for these data structures (using the element &lt;wan-replication-ref&gt; in the configuration of IMap or ICache). - `group-name`: Configures target cluster's group name. - `class-name`: Name of the class implementation for the WAN replication. - `queue-full-behavior`: Policy to be applied when WAN Replication event queues are full. - `queue-capacity`: Size of the queue of events. Its default value is 10000. - `batch.size`: Maximum size of events that are sent to the target cluster in a single batch. - `batch.max.delay.millis`: Maximum amount of time to be waited before sending a batch of events in case `batch.size` is not reached.  - `snapshot.enabled`: When set to `true`, only the latest events (based on key) are selected and sent in a batch. - `response.timeout.millis`: Time in milliseconds to be waited for the acknowledgment of a sent WAN event to target cluster.  - `ack.type`: Acknowledgment type for each target cluster. - `endpoints`: IP addresses and ports of the cluster members for which the WAN replication is implemented. These endpoints are not necessarily the entire target cluster and WAN does not perform the discovery of other members in the target cluster. It only expects that these IP addresses (or at least some of them) are available. - `group.password`: Configures target cluster's group password.  Other relevant properties are:   - `discovery.period`: Period in seconds in which WAN tries to reestablish connections to failed endpoints. Default is 10 (seconds). - `executorThreadCount`: The number of threads that the `WanBatchReplication` executor will have. The executor is used to send WAN events to the endpoints and ideally you want to have one thread per endpoint. If this property is omitted and you have specified the `endpoints` property, this will be the case. If necessary you can manually define the number of threads that the executor will use. Once the executor has been initialized there is thread affinity between the discovered endpoints and the executor threads - all events for a single endpoint will go through a single executor thread, preserving event order. It is important to determine which number of executor threads is a good value. Failure to do so can lead to performance issues - either contention on a too small number of threads or wasted threads that will not be performing any work.    And the following is the equivalent programmatic configuration snippet:  ```java Config config = new Config();  WanReplicationConfig wrConfig = new WanReplicationConfig(); wrConfig.setName(\&quot;my-wan-cluster-batch\&quot;);  WanPublisherConfig publisherConfig = new WanPublisherConfig(); publisherConfig.setGroupName(\&quot;london\&quot;); publisherConfig.setClassName(\&quot;com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication\&quot;); publisherConfig.setQueueFullBehavior(WANQueueFullBehavior.THROW_EXCEPTION); publisherConfig.setQueueCapacity(1000);  Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; props = publisherConfig.getProperties(); props.put(\&quot;batch.size\&quot;, 500); props.put(\&quot;batch.max.delay.millis\&quot;, 1000); props.put(\&quot;snapshot.enabled\&quot;, false); props.put(\&quot;response.timeout.millis\&quot;, 60000); props.put(\&quot;ack.type\&quot;, WanAcknowledgeType.ACK_ON_OPERATION_COMPLETE.toString()); props.put(\&quot;endpoints\&quot;, \&quot;10.3.5.1:5701,10.3.5.2:5701\&quot;); props.put(\&quot;group.password\&quot;, \&quot;london-pass\&quot;); props.put(\&quot;discovery.period\&quot;, \&quot;20\&quot;); props.put(\&quot;executorThreadCount\&quot;, \&quot;2\&quot;);  wrConfig.addWanPublisherConfig(publisherConfig); config.addWanReplicationConfig(wrConfig); ```  Using this configuration, the cluster running in New York will replicate to Tokyo and London. The Tokyo and London clusters should have similar configurations if you want to run in Active-Active mode.  If the New York and London cluster configurations contain the `wan-replication` element and the Tokyo cluster does not, it means New York and London are active endpoints and Tokyo is a passive endpoint.

    body: "#### Defining WAN Replication Using Discovery SPI  In addition to defining target cluster endpoints with static IP addresses, you can configure WAN to work with the discovery SPI and determine the endpoint IP addresses at runtime. This allows you to use WAN with endpoints on various cloud infrastructures (such as Amazon EC2) where the IP address is not known in advance. Typically you will use a readily available discovery SPI plugin such as &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Hazelcast AWS EC2 discovery plugin&lt;/a&gt; or similar. For more advanced cases, you can provide your own discovery SPI implementation with custom logic for determining the WAN target endpoints such as looking up the endpoints in some service registry.   Following is an example of setting up the WAN replication with the EC2 discovery plugin. You must have the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Hazelcast AWS EC2 discovery plugin&lt;/a&gt; on the classpath.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt; ...   &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster-batch\&quot;&gt;       &lt;wan-publisher group-name=\&quot;london\&quot;&gt;           &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication&lt;/class-name&gt;           &lt;queue-full-behavior&gt;THROW_EXCEPTION&lt;/queue-full-behavior&gt;           &lt;queue-capacity&gt;1000&lt;/queue-capacity&gt;           &lt;properties&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;batch.size\&quot;&gt;500&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;batch.max.delay.millis\&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;snapshot.enabled\&quot;&gt;false&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;response.timeout.millis\&quot;&gt;60000&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;ack.type\&quot;&gt;ACK_ON_OPERATION_COMPLETE&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;group.password\&quot;&gt;london-pass&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;discovery.period\&quot;&gt;20&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;maxEndpoints\&quot;&gt;5&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;executorThreadCount\&quot;&gt;5&lt;/property&gt;           &lt;/properties&gt;           &lt;discovery-strategies&gt;               &lt;discovery-strategy enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; class=\&quot;com.hazelcast.aws.AwsDiscoveryStrategy\&quot;&gt;                   &lt;properties&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;access-key\&quot;&gt;test-access-key&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;secret-key\&quot;&gt;test-secret-key&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;region\&quot;&gt;test-region&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;iam-role\&quot;&gt;test-iam-role&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;host-header\&quot;&gt;ec2.test-host-header&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;security-group-name\&quot;&gt;test-security-group-name&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;tag-key\&quot;&gt;test-tag-key&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;tag-value\&quot;&gt;test-tag-value&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;connection-timeout-seconds\&quot;&gt;10&lt;/property&gt;                       &lt;property name=\&quot;hz-port\&quot;&gt;5702&lt;/property&gt;                   &lt;/properties&gt;               &lt;/discovery-strategy&gt;           &lt;/discovery-strategies&gt;       &lt;/wan-publisher&gt;   &lt;/wan-replication&gt; ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  The `hz-port` property defines the port on which the target endpoint is running. The default port 5701 is used if this property is not defined. This is needed because the Amazon API which the AWS plugin uses does not provide the port on which Hazelcast is running, only the IP address. For some other discovery SPI implementations, this might not be necessary and it might discover the port as well, e.g., by looking up in a service registry.   The other properties are the same as when using the `aws` element. In case of EC2 discovery you can configure the WAN replication using the `aws` element. You may use either of these, but not both at the same time.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt; ...   &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster-batch\&quot;&gt;       &lt;wan-publisher group-name=\&quot;london\&quot;&gt;           &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication&lt;/class-name&gt;           &lt;queue-full-behavior&gt;THROW_EXCEPTION&lt;/queue-full-behavior&gt;           &lt;queue-capacity&gt;1000&lt;/queue-capacity&gt;           &lt;properties&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;batch.size\&quot;&gt;500&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;batch.max.delay.millis\&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;snapshot.enabled\&quot;&gt;false&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;response.timeout.millis\&quot;&gt;60000&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;ack.type\&quot;&gt;ACK_ON_OPERATION_COMPLETE&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;group.password\&quot;&gt;london-pass&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;discovery.period\&quot;&gt;20&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;maxEndpoints\&quot;&gt;5&lt;/property&gt;               &lt;property name=\&quot;executorThreadCount\&quot;&gt;5&lt;/property&gt;           &lt;/properties&gt;           &lt;aws enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;               &lt;access-key&gt;my-access-key&lt;/access-key&gt;               &lt;secret-key&gt;my-secret-key&lt;/secret-key&gt;               &lt;iam-role&gt;dummy&lt;/iam-role&gt;               &lt;region&gt;us-west-1&lt;/region&gt;               &lt;host-header&gt;ec2.amazonaws.com&lt;/host-header&gt;               &lt;security-group-name&gt;hazelcast-sg&lt;/security-group-name&gt;               &lt;tag-key&gt;type&lt;/tag-key&gt;               &lt;tag-value&gt;hz-members&lt;/tag-value&gt;           &lt;/aws&gt;       &lt;/wan-publisher&gt;   &lt;/wan-replication&gt; ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  You can refer to the [aws element](#aws-element) and the [Configuring Client for AWS](#configuring-client-for-aws) sections for the descriptions of above AWS configuration elements. Following are the definitions of additional configuration properties:  - `discovery.period`: Period in seconds in which WAN tries to discover new endpoints and reestablish connections to failed endpoints. Default is 10 (seconds). - `maxEndpoints`: Maximum number of endpoints that WAN will connect to when using a discovery mechanism to define endpoints. Default is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This property has no effect when static endpoint IPs are defined using the `endpoints` property. - `executorThreadCount`: Number of threads that the `WanBatchReplication` executor will have. The executor is used to send WAN events to the endpoints and ideally you want to have one thread per endpoint. If this property is omitted and you have specified the `endpoints` property, this will be the case. If, on the other hand, you are using WAN with the discovery SPI and you have not specified this property, the executor will be sized to the initial number of discovered endpoints. This can lead to performance issues if the number of endpoints changes in the future - either contention on a too small number of threads or wasted threads that will not be performing any work. To prevent this you can manually define the executor thread count. Once the executor has been initialized there is thread affinity between the discovered endpoints and the executor threads - all events for a single endpoint will go through a single executor thread, preserving event order.  You can also define the WAN publisher with discovery SPI using the programmatic configuration:   ```java Config config = new Config();  WanReplicationConfig wrConfig = new WanReplicationConfig(); wrConfig.setName(\&quot;my-wan-cluster-batch\&quot;);  WanPublisherConfig publisherConfig = new WanPublisherConfig(); publisherConfig.setGroupName(\&quot;london\&quot;); publisherConfig.setClassName(\&quot;com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication\&quot;); publisherConfig.setQueueFullBehavior(WANQueueFullBehavior.THROW_EXCEPTION); publisherConfig.setQueueCapacity(1000);  Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; props = publisherConfig.getProperties(); props.put(\&quot;batch.size\&quot;, 500); props.put(\&quot;batch.max.delay.millis\&quot;, 1000); props.put(\&quot;snapshot.enabled\&quot;, false); props.put(\&quot;response.timeout.millis\&quot;, 60000); props.put(\&quot;ack.type\&quot;, WanAcknowledgeType.ACK_ON_OPERATION_COMPLETE.toString()); props.put(\&quot;group.password\&quot;, \&quot;london-pass\&quot;); props.put(\&quot;discovery.period\&quot;, \&quot;20\&quot;); props.put(\&quot;executorThreadCount\&quot;, \&quot;2\&quot;);  DiscoveryConfig discoveryConfig = new DiscoveryConfig();  DiscoveryStrategyConfig discoveryStrategyConfig = new DiscoveryStrategyConfig(\&quot;com.hazelcast.aws.AwsDiscoveryStrategy\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;access-key\&quot;,\&quot;test-access-key\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;secret-key\&quot;,\&quot;test-secret-key\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;region\&quot;,\&quot;test-region\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;iam-role\&quot;,\&quot;test-iam-role\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;host-header\&quot;,\&quot;ec2.test-host-header\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;security-group-name\&quot;,\&quot;test-security-group-name\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;tag-key\&quot;,\&quot;test-tag-key\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;tag-value\&quot;,\&quot;test-tag-value\&quot;); discoveryStrategyConfig.addProperty(\&quot;hz-port\&quot;,5702);  discoveryConfig.addDiscoveryStrategyConfig(discoveryStrategyConfig); publisherConfig.setDiscoveryConfig(discoveryConfig); wrConfig.addWanPublisherConfig(publisherConfig); config.addWanReplicationConfig(wrConfig); ```   "

To achieve this, configure the map that you want replicated by adding the `wan-replication-ref` element in the map configuration as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;     ...   &lt;/wan-replication&gt;   &lt;map name=\&quot;my-shared-map\&quot;&gt;     &lt;wan-replication-ref name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;        &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;/merge-policy&gt;        &lt;republishing-enabled&gt;false&lt;/republishing-enabled&gt;     &lt;/wan-replication-ref&gt;   &lt;/map&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:  ```java Config config = new Config();  WanReplicationConfig wrConfig = new WanReplicationConfig(); WanTargetClusterConfig  wtcConfig = wrConfig.getWanTargetClusterConfig();  wrConfig.setName(\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;); ... config.addWanReplicationConfig(wrConfig);  WanReplicationRef wanRef = new WanReplicationRef(); wanRef.setName(\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;); wanRef.setMergePolicy(PassThroughMergePolicy.class.getName()); wanRef.setRepublishingEnabled(false); config.getMapConfig(\&quot;my-shared-map\&quot;).setWanReplicationRef(wanRef); ```  You see that we have `my-shared-map` configured to replicate itself to the cluster targets defined in the earlier `wan-replication` element.  `wan-replication-ref` has the following elements;  - `name`: Name of `wan-replication` configuration. IMap or ICache instance uses this `wan-replication` configuration.  - `merge-policy`: Resolve conflicts that are occurred when target cluster already has the replicated entry key. - `republishing-enabled`: When enabled, an incoming event to a member is forwarded to target cluster of that member. Enabling the event republishing is useful in a scenario where cluster A replicates to cluster B, and cluster B replicates to cluster C. You do not need to enable republishing when all your clusters replicate to each other.   When using Active-Active Replication, multiple clusters can simultaneously update the same entry in a distributed data structure. You can configure a merge policy to resolve these potential conflicts, as shown in the above example configuration (using the `merge-policy` sub-element under the `wan-replication-ref` element).  Hazelcast provides the following merge policies for IMap:  - `com.hazelcast.map.merge.PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map if it does not exist in the target map. - `com.hazelcast.map.merge.HigherHitsMapMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map if the source entry has more hits than the target one. - `com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map unless the incoming entry is not null. - `com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map if the source entry has been updated more recently than the target entry. Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *When using WAN replication, please note that only key based events are replicated to the target cluster. Operations like `clear`, `destroy` and `evictAll` are NOT replicated.*  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  **Enabling WAN Replication for ICache:**  The following is a declarative configuration example for enabling WAN Replication for ICache:   ```xml &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;    ... &lt;/wan-replication&gt; &lt;cache name=\&quot;my-shared-cache\&quot;&gt;    &lt;wan-replication-ref name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;       &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.cache.merge.PassThroughCacheMergePolicy&lt;/merge-policy&gt;       &lt;republishing-enabled&gt;true&lt;/republishing-enabled&gt;    &lt;/wan-replication-ref&gt; &lt;/cache&gt; ```  The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:   ```java Config config = new Config();  WanReplicationConfig wrConfig = new WanReplicationConfig(); WanTargetClusterConfig  wtcConfig = wrConfig.getWanTargetClusterConfig();  wrConfig.setName(\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;); ... config.addWanReplicationConfig(wrConfig);  WanReplicationRef cacheWanRef = new WanReplicationRef(); cacheWanRef.setName(\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;); cacheWanRef.setMergePolicy(\&quot;com.hazelcast.cache.merge.PassThroughCacheMergePolicy\&quot;); cacheWanRef.setRepublishingEnabled(true); config.getCacheConfig(\&quot;my-shared-cache\&quot;).setWanReplicationRef(cacheWanRef); ```  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Caches that are created dynamically do not support WAN replication functionality. Cache configurations should be defined either declaratively (by XML) or programmatically on both source and target clusters.*   Hazelcast provides the following merge policies for ICache:  - `com.hazelcast.cache.merge.HigherHitsCacheMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to the target cache if the source entry has more hits than the target one. - `com.hazelcast.cache.merge.PassThroughCacheMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to the target cache unless the incoming entry is not null."

Using this API, you can monitor WAN replication events of each data structure separately.  You can attach filters to your data structures using  `filter` property of `wan-replication-ref` configuration inside `hazelcast.xml` as shown in the following example configuration. You can also configure it using programmatic configuration.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;map name=\&quot;testMap\&quot;&gt;     &lt;wan-replication-ref name=\&quot;test\&quot;&gt;       ...       &lt;filters&gt;         &lt;filter-impl&gt;com.example.SampleFilter&lt;/filter-impl&gt;         &lt;filter-impl&gt;com.example.SampleFilter2&lt;/filter-impl&gt;       &lt;/filters&gt;     &lt;/wan-replication-ref&gt;   &lt;/map&gt;\&quot; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  As shown in the above configuration, you can define more than one filter. Filters are called in the order that they are introduced. A WAN replication event is only eligible to publish if it passes all the filters.  Map and Cache have different filter interfaces. These interfaces are shown below.  **For map**:  ```java package com.hazelcast.map.wan.filter; ...  /**  * Wan event filtering interface for {@link com.hazelcast.core.IMap}  * based wan replication events  *  * @param &lt;K&gt; the type of the key  * @param &lt;V&gt; the type of the value  */ public interface MapWanEventFilter&lt;K, V&gt; {      /**      * This method decides whether this entry view is suitable to replicate      * over WAN      *      * @param mapName      * @param entryView      * @return &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if WAN event is not eligible for replication      */     boolean filter(String mapName, EntryView&lt;K, V&gt; entryView, WanFilterEventType eventType); } ```   **For cache**:  ```java package com.hazelcast.cache.wan.filter; ...  /**  * Wan event filtering interface for cache based wan replication events  *  * @param &lt;K&gt; the type of the key  * @param &lt;V&gt; the type of the value  */ public interface CacheWanEventFilter&lt;K, V&gt; {      /**      * This method decides whether this entry view is suitable to replicate      * over WAN.      *      * @param entryView      * @return &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if WAN event is not eligible for replication.      */     boolean filter(String cacheName, CacheEntryView&lt;K, V&gt; entryView, WanFilterEventType eventType); } ```  The method `filter` takes three parameters:  - `mapName`/`cacheName`: Name of the related data structure. - `entryView`: [EntryView](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/core/EntryView.java)  or [CacheEntryView](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/cache/CacheEntryView.java) depending on the data structure. - `eventType`: Enum type - `UPDATED(1)` or `REMOVED(2)` - depending on the event.

Newly discovered endpoints may include addresses to which WAN replication has previously failed.

All these features are done with the steps below. Each step adds a new functionality to this counter.  1. Create the class. 2. Enable the class. 3. Add properties. 5. Place a remote call. 5.

This class (named CounterService in the following example code) is the gateway between Hazelcast internals and the counter, allowing us to add features to the counter. The following example code creates the class `CounterService`. Its lifecycle is managed by Hazelcast.   `CounterService` should implement the interface `com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService` as shown below. The `com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService` [source code is here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/ManagedService.java).  `CounterService` implements the following methods.   - `init`: This is called when `CounterService` is initialized. `NodeEngine` enables access to Hazelcast internals such as `HazelcastInstance` and `PartitionService`. Also, the object `Properties` will provide us with the ability to create our own properties. - `shutdown`: This is called when `CounterService` is shutdown. It cleans up the resources. - `reset`: This is called when cluster members face the Split-Brain issue. This occurs when disconnected members that have created their own cluster are merged back into the main cluster. Services can also implement the `SplitBrainHandleService` to indicate that they can take part in the merge process. For `CounterService` we are going to implement `reset` as a no-op.   ```java import com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService; import com.hazelcast.spi.NodeEngine;  import java.util.Properties; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;  public class CounterService implements ManagedService {     private NodeEngine nodeEngine;      @Override     public void init( NodeEngine nodeEngine, Properties properties ) {         System.out.println( \&quot;CounterService.init\&quot; );         this.nodeEngine = nodeEngine;     }      @Override     public void shutdown( boolean terminate ) {         System.out.println( \&quot;CounterService.shutdown\&quot; );     }      @Override     public void reset() {     }  } ```  "

It should be a unique name (`CounterService` in our case) since it will be looked up when a remote call is made. Note that the value of this attribute will be sent at each request, and that a longer `name` value means more data (de)serialization. A good practice is to give an understandable name with the shortest possible length. - Set the `class-name` attribute to the class name of the service (`CounterService` in our case). The class should have a *no-arg* constructor. Otherwise, the object cannot be initialized.  Note that multicast is enabled as the join mechanism.

It does not include the counter state. Therefore, the method `inc` should be invoked on the cluster member hosting the real counter. You can invoke it using Hazelcast SPI; then it will send the operations to the correct member and return the results.  Let's dig deeper into the method `inc`.  - First, we create `IncOperation` with a given `name` and `amount`. - Then, we get the partition ID based on the `name`; by this way, all operations for a given name will result in the same partition ID. - Then, we create an `InvocationBuilder` where the connection between operation and partition is made. - Finally, we invoke the `InvocationBuilder` and wait for its result. This waiting is performed with a `future.get()`. In our case, timeout is not important. However, it is a good practice to use a timeout for a real system since operations should complete in a certain amount of time.   "

See the [PartitionAwareOperation source code here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/PartitionAwareOperation.java).  The method `run` does the actual execution. Since `IncOperation` will return a response, the method `returnsResponse` returns `true`. If your method is asynchronous and does not need to return a response, it is better to return `false` since it will be faster. The actual response is stored in the field `returnValue`; retrieve it with the method `getResponse`.  There are two more methods in this code: `writeInternal` and `readInternal`. Since `IncOperation` needs to be serialized, these two methods are overridden, and hence, `objectId` and `amount` are serialized and available when those operations are executed.   For the deserialization, note that the operation must have a *no-arg* constructor.   ```java import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataInput; import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataOutput; import com.hazelcast.spi.Operation; import com.hazelcast.spi.PartitionAwareOperation;  import java.io.IOException;  class IncOperation extends Operation implements PartitionAwareOperation {     private String objectId;     private int amount, returnValue;      // Important to have a no-arg constructor for deserialization     public IncOperation() {     }      public IncOperation(String objectId, int amount) {         this.amount = amount;         this.objectId = objectId;     }      @Override     public void run() throws Exception {         System.out.println(\&quot;Executing \&quot; + objectId + \&quot;.inc() on: \&quot; + getNodeEngine().getThisAddress());         returnValue = 0;     }      @Override     public Object getResponse() {         return returnValue;     }      @Override     protected void writeInternal(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException {         super.writeInternal(out);         out.writeUTF(objectId);         out.writeInt(amount);     }      @Override     protected void readInternal(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException {         super.readInternal(in);         objectId = in.readUTF();         amount = in.readInt();     } } ```  "

Therefore, when accessing a container, concurrency control will not be an issue.   The code in our example uses a `Container` instance per partition approach. With this approach, there will not be any mutable shared state between partitions. This approach also makes operations on partitions simpler since you do not need to filter out data that does not belong to a certain partition.   The code performs the tasks below.  - It creates a container for every partition with the method `init`. - It creates the proxy with the method `createDistributedObject`. - It removes the value of the object with the method `destroyDistributedObject`, otherwise we may get an OutOfMemory exception.

The result of the `toMigrationData` method is the partition data in a form that can be serialized to another member. - `applyMigrationData`: This method is called when `migrationData` (created by the method `toMigrationData`) will be applied to the member that will be the new partition owner. - `clear`: This method is called when the partition migration is successfully completed and the old partition owner gets rid of all data in the partition. This method is also called when the partition migration operation fails and the to-be-the-new partition owner needs to roll back its changes.  ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;  class Container {     private final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; values = new HashMap();      int inc(String id, int amount) {         Integer counter = values.get(id);         if (counter == null) {             counter = 0;         }         counter += amount;         values.put(id, counter);         return counter;     }      void clear() {         values.clear();     }      void applyMigrationData(Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; migrationData) {         values.putAll(migrationData);     }      Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; toMigrationData() {         return new HashMap(values);     }      public void init(String objectName) {         values.put(objectName,0);     }      public void destroy(String objectName) {         values.remove(objectName);     } } ```   "

    body: "### Creating Backups  Finally, we make sure that the counter data is available on another member when a member goes down. To do this, have the `IncOperation` class implement the `BackupAwareOperation` interface contained in the SPI package. See the following code.  ```java class IncOperation extends Operation 	implements PartitionAwareOperation, BackupAwareOperation {    ...           @Override    public int getAsyncBackupCount() {       return 0;    }     @Override    public int getSyncBackupCount() {       return 1;    }     @Override    public boolean shouldBackup() {       return true;    }     @Override    public Operation getBackupOperation() {       return new IncBackupOperation(objectId, amount);    } } ```  The methods `getAsyncBackupCount` and `getSyncBackupCount` specify the count for asynchronous and synchronous backups. Our sample has one synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. In the above code, counts of the backups are hard-coded, but they can also be passed to `IncOperation` as parameters.   The method `shouldBackup` specifies whether our Operation needs a backup or not. For our sample, it returns `true`, meaning the Operation will always have a backup even if there are no changes. Of course, in real systems, we want to have backups if there is a change. For `IncOperation` for example, having a backup when `amount` is null would be a good practice.  The method `getBackupOperation` returns the operation (`IncBackupOperation`) that actually performs the backup creation; the backup itself is an operation and will run on the same infrastructure.   If a backup should be made and `getSyncBackupCount` returns **3**, then three `IncBackupOperation` instances are created and sent to the three machines containing the backup partition. If fewer machines are available, then backups need to be created. Hazelcast will just send a smaller number of operations.   "

You can see the [OperationParker source code here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/impl/operationparker/OperationParker.java).  `OperationParker` keeps a list of waiters. For each notify operation:  - it looks for a waiter, - it asks the waiter whether it wants to keep waiting, - if the waiter responds *no*, the service executes its registered operation (operation itself knows where to send a response), - it rinses and repeats until a waiter wants to keep waiting.   Each waiter can sit on a wait-notify queue for, at most, its operation's call timeout. For example, by default, each waiter can wait here for at most 1 minute. A continuous task scans expired/timed-out waiters and invalidates them with `CallTimeoutException`. Each waiter on the remote side should retry and keep waiting if it still wants to wait. This is a liveness check for remote waiters.   This way, it is possible to distinguish an unresponsive member and a long (~infinite) wait. On the caller side, if the waiting thread does not get a response for either a call timeout or for more than *2 times the call-timeout*, it will exit with `OperationTimeoutException`.    Note that this behavior breaks the fairness. Hazelcast does not support fairness for any of the data structures with blocking operations, such as Lock and Semaphore."

    title: "A Brief Overview of Consistency and Replication in Distributed Systems",
    body: "## A Brief Overview of Consistency and Replication in Distributed Systems  Partitioning and replication are the two common techniques used together in distributed databases to achieve scalable, available and transparent data distribution. The data space is divided into partitions, each of which contains a distinct portion of the overall data set. For these partitions, multiple copies called replicas are created. Partition replicas are distributed among the cluster members. Each member is assigned to at most a single replica for a partition. In this setting, different replication techniques can be used to access the data and keep the replicas in sync on updates. The technique being used directly affects the guarantees and properties a distributed data store provides, due to the CAP (**C**onsistency, **A**vailability and **P**artition Tolerance) principle.  One aspect of replication techniques is about where a replicated data set is accessed and updated. For instance, primary-copy systems first elect a replica, which can be called as primary, master, etc., and use that replica to access the data. Changes in the data on the primary replica are propagated to other replicas. This approach has different namings, such as _primary-copy_, _single-master_, _passive replication_. The primary-copy technique is a powerful model as it prevents conflicts, deadlocks among the replicas. However, primary replicas can become bottlenecks. On the other hand, we can have a different technique by eliminating the primary-copy and treating each replica as equal. These systems can achieve a higher level of availability as a data entry can be accessed and updated using any replica. However, it can become more difficult to keep the replicas in sync with each other.  Replication techniques also differ in how updates are propagated among replicas.  - One option is to update each replica as part of a single atomic transaction, called as _eager replication_ or _synchronous replication_. Consensus algorithms apply this approach to achieve strong consistency on a replicated data set. The main drawback is the amount of coordination and communication required while running the replication algorithm. CP systems implement consensus algorithms under the hood. - Another option is the _lazy replication_ technique, which is also called as _asynchronous replication_. Lazy replication algorithms execute updates on replicas with separate transactions. They generally work with best-effort. By this way, the amount of coordination among the replicas are degraded and data can be accessed in a more performant manner. Yet, it can happen that a particular update is executed on some replicas but not on others, which will lead replicas to diverge. Such problems can be resolved with different approaches, such as _read-repair_, _write-repair_, _anti-entropy_. Lazy replication techniques are popular among AP systems.  "

    title: "Hazelcast's Replication Algorithm",
    body: "## Hazelcast's Replication Algorithm  The discussion here generally applies to any system that maintains multiple copies of a data set. It applies to Hazelcast as well. In the context of CAP principle, **Hazelcast is an AP product**, which employs the combination of primary-copy and lazy replication techniques. As briefly described in the [Data Partitioning section](#data-partitioning), each data entry is mapped to a single Hazelcast partition and put into replicas of that partition. One of the replicas is elected as the primary replica, which is responsible for performing operations on that partition. When you read or write a map entry, you transparently talk to the Hazelcast member to which primary replica of the corresponding partition is assigned. By this way, each request hits the most up-to-date version of a particular data entry in a stable cluster. Backup replicas stay in standby mode until the primary replica fails. Upon failure of the primary replica, one of the backup replicas are promoted to the primary role.  With _lazy replication_, when the primary replica receives an update operation for a key, it executes the update locally, and propagates it to backup replicas. It marks each update with a logical timestamp so that backups apply them in the correct order and converge to the same state with the primary. Backup replicas can be used to scale reads (see the [Enabling Backup Reads section](#enabling-backup-reads)) with no strong consistency but monotonic reads guarantee.   Hazelcast offers features such as _Quorum_, _ILock_, _AtomicLong_, etc. In the journey of being a highly elastic, dynamic and easy to use product, Hazelcast tries to provide best-effort consistency guarantees without being a complete CP solution. Therefore, we recommend these features to be used for efficiency purposes in general, instead of correctness. For instance, they can be used to prevent to run a resource-extensive computation multiple times, which would not create any correctness problem if runs more than once. Please refer to [Best-Effort Consistency](#best-effort-consistency) and [Network Partitioning](#network-partitioning-split-brain-syndrome) sections for more information.  "

    title: "Best-Effort Consistency",
    body: "### Best-Effort Consistency  Hazelcast's replication technique enables Hazelcast clusters to offer high throughput. However, due to temporary situations in the system, such as network interruption, backup replicas can miss some updates and diverge from the primary. Backup replicas can also hit long GC pauses or VM pauses, and fall behind the primary, which is a situation called as _replication lag_. If a Hazelcast partition primary replica member crashes while there is a replication lag between itself and the backups, strong consistency of the data can be lost.   Please note that CP systems can have similar problems as well. However, in a CP system, once a replica performs an update locally (i.e., _commits_ the update), the underlying consensus algorithm guarantees durability of the update for the rest of the execution.   On the other hand, in AP systems like Hazelcast, a replica can perform an update locally, even if the update is not to be performed on other replicas. This is a fair trade-off to reduce amount of coordination among replicas, and maintain high throughput &amp; high availability of the system. These systems employ additional measurements to maintain consistency in a best-effort manner. In this regard, Hazelcast tries to minimize effect of such scenarios using an active anti-entropy solution as follows:  - Each Hazelcast member runs a periodic task in the background. - For each primary replica it is assigned, it creates a summary information and sends it to the backups. - Then, each backup member compares the summary information with its own data to see if it is up-to-date with the primary. - If a backup member detects a missing update, it triggers the synchronization process with the primary.

    title: "Invocation Lifecycle",
    body: "## Invocation Lifecycle  When a write is requested with the methods, such as `map.put()` or `queue.offer()`, a write operation is submitted to the Hazelcast member that owns the primary replica of the specific partition. Partition of an operation is determined based on a parameter (key of an entry or name of the data structure, etc.) related to that operation depending on the data structure. Target Hazelcast member is figured out by looking up a local partition assignment/ownership table, which is updated on each partition migration and broadcasted to all cluster eventually.  When a Hazelcast member receives a partition specific operation, it executes the operation and propagates it to backup replica(s) with a logical timestamp. Number of backups for each operation depends on the data structure and its configuration. See [Threading Model - Operation Threading](#operation-threading) for threading details.  Two types of backup replication are available: _sync_ and _async_. Despite what their names imply, both types are still implementations of the lazy (async) replication model. The only difference between _sync_ and _async_ is that, the former makes the caller block until backup updates are applied by backup replicas and acknowledgments are sent back to the caller, but the latter is just fire &amp; forget. Number of sync and async backups are defined in the data structure configurations, and you can use a combination of sync and async backups.  When backup updates are propagated, response of the execution including number of sync backup updates is sent to the caller and after receiving the response, caller waits to receive the specified number of sync backup acknowledgements for a predefined timeout. This timeout is 5 seconds by default and defined by the system property `hazelcast.operation.backup.timeout.millis`. (See [System Properties](#system-properties) section.)  A backup update can be missed because of a few reasons, such as a stale partition table information on a backup replica member, network interruption, or a member crash. That's why sync backup acks require a timeout to give up. Regardless of being a sync or async backup, if a backup update is missed, the periodically running anti-entropy mechanism detects the inconsistency and synchronizes backup replicas with the primary. Also the graceful shutdown procedure ensures that all backup replicas for partitions whose primary replicas are assigned to the shutting down member will be consistent.  In some cases, although the target member of an invocation is assumed to be alive by the failure detector, the target may not execute the operation or send the response back in time. Network splits, long pauses caused by high load, GC or IO (disk, network) can be listed as a few possible reasons. When an invocation doesn't receive any response from the member that owns primary replica, then invocation fails with an `OperationTimeoutException`. This timeout is 2 minutes by default and defined by the system property `hazelcast.operation.call.timeout.millis`. (See [System Properties](#system-properties) section.) When timeout is passed, result of the invocation will be indeterminate.  "

If that happens, the operation will be executed twice.  In the following failure case, invocation state will become indeterminate:  * As explained above, when an invocation does not receive a response in time, invocation will fail with an `OperationTimeoutException`.

Hazelcast 3.9 introduces a new mechanism to detect indeterminate situations while making such invocations. If `hazelcast.operation.fail.on.indeterminate.state` system property is enabled, a *mutating* invocation throws `IndeterminateOperationStateException` when it encounters the following cases:  - The operation fails on partition primary replica member with `MemberLeftException`. In this case, the caller may not determine the status of the operation. It could happen that the primary replica executes the operation, but fails before replicating it to all the required backup replicas. Even if the caller receives backup acks from some backup replicas, it cannot decide if it has received all required ack responses, since it does not know how many acks it should wait for.  - There is at least one missing ack from the backup replicas for the given timeout duration. In this case, the caller knows that the operation is executed on the primary replica, but some backup may have missed it. It could be also a false-positive, if the backup timeout duration is configured with a very small value. However, Hazelcast's active anti-entropy mechanism eventually kicks in and resolves durability of the write on all available backup replicas as long as the primary replica member is alive.   When an invocation fails with `IndeterminateOperationStateException`, the system does not try to rollback the changes which are executed on healthy replicas. Effect of a failed invocation may be even observed by another caller, if the invocation has succeeded on the primary replica. Hence, this new behavior does not guarantee linearizability. However, if an invocation completes without `IndeterminateOperationStateException` when the configuration is enabled, it is guaranteed that the operation has been executed exactly-once on the primary replica and specified number of backup replicas of the partition.    Please note that `IndeterminateOperationStateException` does not apply to read-only operations, such as `map.get()`. If a partition primary replica node crashes before replying to a read-only operation, the operation is retried on the new owner of the primary replica.   "

Even though this communication failure is called as _network partitioning_, in practice a process or an entire OS that's suspending/pausing very long can cause communication interruptions. If these interruptions take long enough time to assume that the other side is crashed, the cluster splits into multiple partitions and they start operating independently. That's why any communication failure/interruption long enough can be classified as network partitioning.  Moreover, communication failures don't have to be symmetrical. A network failure can interrupt only one side of the channel or a suspended process/member may not even observe the rest as crashed. That kind of network partitioning can be called as _partial network partitioning_.  "

It does NOT refer to an implementation of Paxos or Raft protocols as used in some NoSQL systems.*  How to respond to a split-brain scenario depends on whether consistency of data or availability of your application is of primary concern. In either case, because a split-brain scenario is caused by a network failure, you must initiate an effort to identify and correct the network failure. Your cluster cannot be brought back to steady state operation until the underlying network failure is fixed. If consistency is your primary concern, you can use Hazelcast's  Split-Brain Protection feature.  Hazelcast's Split-Brain Protection enables you to specify the minimum cluster size required for operations to occur. This is achieved by defining and configuring a split-brain protection cluster quorum. If the cluster size is below the defined quorum, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a `QuorumException` to their callers.  Your application continues its operations on the remaining operating cluster. Any application instances connected to the cluster with sizes below the defined quorum will be receiving exceptions which, depending on the programming and monitoring setup, should generate alerts. The key point is that rather than applications continuing in error with stale data, they are prevented from doing so.  Split-Brain Protection is supported for the following Hazelcast data structures:  * Map (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions) * Transactional Map (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions) * Cache (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions) * Lock (for Hazelcast 3.8 and higher versions) * Queue (for Hazelcast 3.8 and higher versions)  Each data structure to be protected should have the configuration added to it as explained in the [Configuring Split-Brain Protection section](#configuring-split-brain-protection).

If returns null, then the entry will be removed.      */     Object merge(String mapName, EntryView mergingEntry, EntryView existingEntry);  } ```  ```java public interface CacheMergePolicy extends Serializable {      /**      * &lt;p&gt;      * Selects one of the merging and existing cache entries to be merged.      * &lt;/p&gt;      *      * &lt;p&gt;      * Note that as mentioned also in arguments, the {@link CacheEntryView} instance that represents existing cache entry      * may be null if there is no existing entry for the specified key in the the {@link CacheEntryView} instance      * that represents merging cache entry.      * &lt;/p&gt;      *      * @param cacheName     name of the cache      * @param mergingEntry  {@link CacheEntryView} instance that has cache entry to be merged      * @param existingEntry {@link CacheEntryView} instance that has existing cache entry.      *                      This entry may be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if there is no existing cache entry.      * @return the selected value for merging      */     Object merge(String cacheName, CacheEntryView mergingEntry, CacheEntryView existingEntry); } ```  There are built-in merge policies such as `PassThroughMergePolicy`, `PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy`, `HigherHitsMapMergePolicy` and `LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy`. Additionally you can develop your own merge policy by implementing the relevant interface. You should set the full class name of your implementation to the merge-policy configuration.

Values can be `client` or `server`. `hazelcast.jmx` | false | bool  |   Enable [JMX](#monitoring-with-jmx) agent. `hazelcast.legacy.memberlist.format.enabled`  | false  |  bool  |  Enables the legacy (for the releases before Hazelcast 3.9) member list format which is printed in the logs. The new format is introduced starting with Hazelcast 3.9 and includes member list version. Any change in the cluster, such as a member leaving or joining, will increment the member list version.&lt;br&gt;Please see the [Starting the Member and Client section](#starting-the-member-and-client). `hazelcast.local.localAddress`| | string | It is an overrider property for the default server socket listener's IP address.

Please refer to the [Map Store section](#map-store) for the description of the `write-coalescing` element. `hazelcast.master.confirmation.interval.seconds` | 30 | int  |   Interval at which members send master confirmation. `hazelcast.mastership.claim.timeout.seconds`  | 120  | int  | Timeout which defines when master candidate gives up waiting for response to its mastership claim. After timeout happens, non-responding member will be removed from the member list. `hazelcast.max.join.merge.target.seconds`|20|int|Split-brain merge timeout for a specific target. `hazelcast.max.join.seconds`|300|int| Join timeout, maximum time to try to join before giving. `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds` | 60 | int  |   Maximum timeout of heartbeat in seconds for a member to assume it is dead. ***CAUTION***: *Setting this value too low may cause members to be evicted from the cluster when they are under heavy load: they will be unable to send heartbeat operations in time, so other members will assume that it is dead.* `hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds` | 150 | int  |   Max timeout of master confirmation from other members. `hazelcast.max.wait.seconds.before.join` | 20 | int  |   Maximum wait time before join operation. `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.instance.count` | 100 | int  |   Management Center maximum visible instance count. `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.slow.operations.count`|10|int|Management Center maximum visible slow operations count. `hazelcast.mc.url.change.enabled` | true | bool  |   Management Center changing server url is enabled. `hazelcast.member.list.publish.interval.seconds` | 60 | int  |   Interval at which master member publishes a member list. `hazelcast.memcache.enabled`| false | bool |   Enable [Memcache](#memcache-client) client request listener service. `hazelcast.merge.first.run.delay.seconds` | 300 | int |   Initial run delay of [split brain/merge process](#network-partitioning-split-brain-syndrome) in seconds. `hazelcast.merge.next.run.delay.seconds` | 120 | int |   Run interval of [split brain/merge process](#network-partitioning-split-brain-syndrome) in seconds. `hazelcast.migration.min.delay.on.member.removed.seconds`|5|int|Minimum delay (in seconds) between detection of a member that has left and start of the rebalancing process. `hazelcast.operation.backup.timeout.millis`|5000|int|Maximum time a caller to wait for backup responses of an operation. After this timeout, operation response will be returned to the caller even no backup response is received. `hazelcast.operation.fail.on.indeterminate.state`| false | bool | When enabled, an operation fails with `IndeterminateOperationStateException`, if it does not receive backup acks in time with respect to backup configuration of its data structure, or the member which owns primary replica of the target partition leaves the cluster. `hazelcast.operation.call.timeout.millis`| 60000 | int | Timeout to wait for a response when a remote call is sent, in milliseconds. `hazelcast.operation.generic.thread.count` | -1 | int | Number of generic operation handler threads. `-1` means CPU core count / 2. `hazelcast.operation.responsequeue.idlestrategy`|block|string|Specifies whether the response thread for internal operations at the member side will be blocked or not. If you use `block` (the default value) the thread will be blocked and need to be notified which can cause a reduction in the performance. If you use `backoff` there will be no blocking. By enabling the backoff mode and depending on your use case, you can get a 5-10% performance improvement. However, keep in mind that this will increase CPU utilization. We recommend you to use backoff with care and if you have a tool for measuring your cluster's performance. `hazelcast.operation.thread.count` | -1 | int | Number of partition based operation handler threads. `-1` means CPU core count. `hazelcast.partition.backup.sync.interval`|30|int|Interval for syncing backup replicas. `hazelcast.partition.count` | 271 | int  |   Total partition count. `hazelcast.partition.max.parallel.replications`|5|int|Maximum number of parallel partition backup replication operations per member. When a partition backup ownership changes or a backup inconsistency is detected, the members start to sync their backup partitions. This parameter limits the maximum running replication operations in parallel. `hazelcast.partition.migration.fragments.enabled` | true | bool | When enabled, which is the default behavior, partitions are migrated/replicated in small fragments instead of one big chunk. Migrating partitions in fragments reduces pressure on the memory and network, since smaller packets are created in the memory and sent through the network. Note that it can increase the migration time to complete. `hazelcast.partition.migration.interval` | 0 | int |   Interval to run partition migration tasks in seconds. `hazelcast.partition.migration.stale.read.disabled` | false | bool | Hazelcast allows read operations to be performed while a partition is being migrated. This can lead to stale reads for some scenarios. You can disable stale read operations by setting this system property's value to \&quot;true\&quot;. Its default value is \&quot;false\&quot;, meaning that stale reads are allowed. `hazelcast.partition.migration.timeout` | 300 | int  |   Timeout for partition migration tasks in seconds. `hazelcast.partition.table.send.interval`|15|int|Interval for publishing partition table periodically to all cluster members. `hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class`|null|string|Class name implementing `com.hazelcast.core.PartitioningStrategy`, which defines key to partition mapping. `hazelcast.performance.monitor.max.rolled.file.count`|10|int|The PerformanceMonitor uses a rolling file approach to prevent eating too much disk space. This property sets the maximum number of rolling files to keep on disk. `hazelcast.performance.monitor.max.rolled.file.size.mb`|10|int|The performance monitor uses a rolling file approach to prevent eating too much disk space. This property sets the maximum size in MB for a single file. Every HazelcastInstance gets its own history of log files. `hazelcast.performance.monitoring.enabled`||bool|Enable the performance monitor, a tool which allows you to see internal performance metrics. These metrics are written to a dedicated log file. `hazelcast.performance.monitor.delay.seconds`||int| The period between successive entries in the performance monitor's log file. `hazelcast.prefer.ipv4.stack` | true | bool  |   Prefer IPv4 network interface when picking a local address. `hazelcast.query.max.local.partition.limit.for.precheck`|3|int|Maximum value of local partitions to trigger local pre-check for TruePredicate query operations on maps. `hazelcast.query.optimizer.type`|RULES|String|Type of the query optimizer. For optimizations based on static rules, set the value to `RULES`. To disable the optimization, set the value to `NONE`. `hazelcast.query.predicate.parallel.evaluation`|false|bool|Each Hazelcast member evaluates query predicates using a single thread by default. In most cases, the overhead of inter-thread communications overweight can benefit from parallel execution. When you have a large dataset and/or slow predicate, you may benefit from parallel predicate evaluations. Set to `true` if you are using slow predicates or have &gt; 100,000s entries per member. `hazelcast.query.result.size.limit`|-1|int|Result size limit for query operations on maps. This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result. If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown. Its default value is -1, meaning it is disabled. `hazelcast.rest.enabled` | false | bool |   Enable [REST](#rest-client) client request listener service. `hazelcast.shutdownhook.enabled` | true | bool  | Enable Hazelcast shutdownhook thread. When this is enabled, this thread terminates the Hazelcast instance without waiting to shutdown gracefully. `hazelcast.shutdownhook.policy`|TERMINATE|string| Specifies the behavior when JVM is exiting while the Hazelcast instance is still running. It has two values: TERMINATE and GRACEFUL. The former one terminates the Hazelcast instance immediately. The latter, GRACEFUL, initiates the graceful shutdown which can significantly slow down the JVM exit process, but it tries to retain data safety. Note that you should always shutdown Hazelcast explicitly via using the method `HazelcastInstance#shutdown()`. It's not recommended to rely on the shutdown hook, this is a last-effort measure. `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.enabled`|true|bool|Enables/disables the [SlowOperationDetector](#slowoperationdetector). `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.log.purge.interval.seconds`|300|int|Purge interval for slow operation logs. `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.log.retention.seconds`|3600|int|Defines the retention time of invocations in slow operation logs. If an invocation is older than this value, it will be purged from the log to prevent unlimited memory usage. When all invocations are purged from a log, the log itself will be deleted. `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.stacktrace.logging.enabled`|false|bool|Defines if the stacktraces of slow operations are logged in the log file. Stack traces are always reported to the Management Center, but by default, they are not printed to keep the log size small. `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.threshold.millis`|10000|int|Defines a threshold above which a running operation in `OperationService` is considered to be slow. These operations log a warning and are shown in the Management Center with detailed information, e.g., stacktrace. `hazelcast.socket.bind.any` | true | bool | Bind both server-socket and client-sockets to any local interface. `hazelcast.socket.client.bind`|true|bool|Bind client socket to an interface when connecting to a remote server socket. When set to `false`, client socket is not bound to any interface. `hazelcast.socket.client.bind.any` | true | bool |   Bind client-sockets to any local interface. If not set, `hazelcast.socket.bind.any` will be used as default. `hazelcast.socket.client.receive.buffer.size`|-1|int|Hazelcast creates all connections with receive buffer size set according to the `hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size`. When it detects a connection opened by a client, then it adjusts the receive buffer size according to this property. It is in kilobytes and the default value is -1. `hazelcast.socket.client.send.buffer.size`|-1|int|Hazelcast creates all connections with send buffer size set according to the `hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size`. When it detects a connection opened by a client, then it adjusts the send buffer size according to this property. It is in kilobytes and the default value is -1. `hazelcast.socket.connect.timeout.seconds`|0|int|Socket connection timeout in seconds. `Socket.connect()` will be blocked until either connection is established or connection is refused or this timeout passes. Default is 0, means infinite. `hazelcast.socket.keep.alive` | true | bool  | Socket set keep alive (`SO_KEEPALIVE`). `hazelcast.socket.linger.seconds`|0|int|Set socket `SO_LINGER` option. `hazelcast.socket.no.delay` | true | bool  |   Socket set TCP no delay. `hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size` | 128 | int | Socket receive buffer (`SO_RCVBUF`) size in KB. If you have a very fast network, e.g., 10gbit) and/or you have large entries, then you may benefit from increasing sender/receiver buffer sizes. Use this property and the next one below tune the size.  `hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size` | 128 | int  | Socket send buffer (`SO_SNDBUF`) size in KB. `hazelcast.socket.server.bind.any` | true | bool | Bind server-socket to any local interface. If not set, `hazelcast.socket.bind.any` will be used as default. `hazelcast.tcp.join.port.try.count`|3|int|The number of incremental ports, starting with the port number defined in the network configuration, that will be used to connect to a host (which is defined without a port in TCP/IP member list while a member is searching for a cluster). `hazelcast.unsafe.mode` | auto | string  | \&quot;auto\&quot; (the default value) automatically detects whether the usage of `Unsafe` is suitable for a given platform. \&quot;disabled\&quot; explicitly disables the `Unsafe` usage in your platform. \&quot;enforced\&quot; enforces the usage of `Unsafe` even if your platform does not support it. This property can only be set by passing a JVM-wide system property. `hazelcast.phone.home.enabled` | true | bool  |   Enable or disable the sending of phone home data to Hazelcast's phone home server. `hazelcast.wait.seconds.before.join` | 5 | int  | Wait time before join operation. `hazelcast.wan.map.useDeleteWhenProcessingRemoveEvents` | false | bool  |   Configures WAN replication for `IMap` on the PASSIVE cluster to remove entries using delete instead of remove and when using `com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication` as an endpoint implementation. The member which receives the event batch in the PASSIVE cluster dispatches WAN events to the partition owners as map merge and remove operations. When using remove operations, the old entry value is sent from the partition owner to the caller even though the caller does not use the old value. This can also lead to issues if the PASSIVE cluster does not contain the class definition for the entry value as the value will try to get deserialized, causing `ClassNotFoundException`s. You can switch to using map remove instead on the PASSIVE cluster with this property. This will both save bandwidth and avoid the exception.  "

    body: "## How do I choose keys properly?  When you store a key and value in a distributed Map, Hazelcast serializes the key and value, and stores the byte array version of them in local ConcurrentHashMaps. These ConcurrentHashMaps use `equals` and `hashCode` methods of byte array version of your key. It does not take into account the actual `equals` and `hashCode` implementations of your objects. So it is important that you choose your keys in a proper way.   Implementing `equals` and `hashCode` is not enough, it is also important that the object is always serialized into the same byte array. All primitive types like String, Long, Integer, etc. are good candidates for keys to be used in Hazelcast. An unsorted Set is an example of a very bad candidate because Java Serialization may serialize the same unsorted set in two different byte arrays.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

    title: "How do I test my Hazelcast cluster?",
    body: "## How do I test my Hazelcast cluster?  Hazelcast allows you to create more than one instance on the same JVM. Each member is called `HazelcastInstance` and each will have its own configuration, socket and threads, so you can treat them as totally separate instances.   This enables you to write and to run cluster unit tests on a single JVM. Because you can use this feature for creating separate members different applications running on the same JVM (imagine running multiple web applications on the same JVM), you can also use this feature for testing your Hazelcast cluster.  Let's say you want to test if two members have the same size of a map.  ```java @Test public void testTwoMemberMapSizes() {   // start the first member   HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   // get the map and put 1000 entries   Map map1 = h1.getMap( \&quot;testmap\&quot; );   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++ ) {     map1.put( i, \&quot;value\&quot; + i );   }   // check the map size   assertEquals( 1000, map1.size() );   // start the second member   HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   // get the same map from the second member   Map map2 = h2.getMap( \&quot;testmap\&quot; );   // check the size of map2   assertEquals( 1000, map2.size() );   // check the size of map1 again   assertEquals( 1000, map1.size() ); } ```  In the test above, everything happens in the same thread. When developing a multi-threaded test, you need to carefully handle coordination of the thread executions. it is highly recommended that you use `CountDownLatch` for thread coordination (you can certainly use other ways). Here is an example where we need to listen for messages and make sure that we got these messages.  ```java @Test public void testTopic() {   // start two member cluster   HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   String topicName = \&quot;TestMessages\&quot;;   // get a topic from the first member and add a messageListener   ITopic&lt;String&gt; topic1 = h1.getTopic( topicName );   final CountDownLatch latch1 = new CountDownLatch( 1 );   topic1.addMessageListener( new MessageListener() {     public void onMessage( Object msg ) {       assertEquals( \&quot;Test1\&quot;, msg );       latch1.countDown();     }   });   // get a topic from the second member and add a messageListener   ITopic&lt;String&gt; topic2 = h2.getTopic(topicName);   final CountDownLatch latch2 = new CountDownLatch( 2 );   topic2.addMessageListener( new MessageListener() {     public void onMessage( Object msg ) {       assertEquals( \&quot;Test1\&quot;, msg );       latch2.countDown();     }   } );   // publish the first message, both should receive this   topic1.publish( \&quot;Test1\&quot; );   // shutdown the first member   h1.shutdown();   // publish the second message, second member's topic should receive this   topic2.publish( \&quot;Test1\&quot; );   try {     // assert that the first member's topic got the message     assertTrue( latch1.await( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) );     // assert that the second members' topic got two messages     assertTrue( latch2.await( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) );   } catch ( InterruptedException ignored ) {   } } ``` You can start Hazelcast members with different configurations. Remember to call `Hazelcast.shutdownAll()` after each test case to make sure that there is no other running member left from the previous tests.  ```java @After public void cleanup() throws Exception {   Hazelcast.shutdownAll(); } ```  For more information please &lt;a href=\&quot;https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/tree/master/hazelcast/src/test/java/com/hazelcast/cluster\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;check our existing tests&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   "

Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, graceful shutdown of a Hazelcast member can be initiated any time as follows:    ```java   hazelcastInstance.shutdown();  ```  Once a Hazelcast member initiates a graceful shutdown, data of the shutting down member is migrated to the other nodes automatically.  However, there is no such guarantee for termination.  Below code snippet terminates a member if the cluster is safe, which means that there are no partitions being migrated and all backups are in sync when this method is called.  ```java PartitionService partitionService = hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService(); if (partitionService.isClusterSafe()) {   hazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().terminate();  } ```  Below code snippet terminates the local member if the member is safe to terminate, which means that all backups of partitions currently owned by local member are in sync when this method is called.  ```java PartitionService partitionService = hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService(); if (partitionService.isLocalMemberSafe()) {   hazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().terminate(); } ```  Please keep in mind that two code snippets shown above are inherently racy. If member failures occur in the cluster after the safety condition check passes, termination of the local member can lead to data loss.

    body: "## OOME: Unable to create new native thread?  If you encounter an error of `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread`, it may be caused by exceeding the available file descriptors on your operating system, especially if it is Linux. This exception is usually thrown on a running member, after a period of time when the thread count exhausts the file descriptor availability.  The JVM on Linux consumes a file descriptor for each thread created.  The default number of file descriptors available in Linux is usually 1024. If you have many JVMs running on a single machine, it is possible to exceed this default number.  You can view the limit using the following command.  `# ulimit -a`  At the operating system level, Linux users can control the amount of resources (and in particular, file descriptors) used via one of the following options.  1 - Editing the `limits.conf` file:  `# vi /etc/security/limits.conf`   ``` testuser soft nofile 4096&lt;br&gt; testuser hard nofile 10240&lt;br&gt; ```  2 - Or using the `ulimit` command:  `# ulimit -Hn`  ``` 10240 ```  The default number of process per users is 1024. Adding the following to your `$HOME/.profile` could solve the issue:  `# ulimit -u 4096`  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

If a repartitioning will happen while an entry processor is active in a member processing on an entry object, the repartitioning waits for the entry processor to complete its job.  "

Assume you have two instances on two different machines and you develop a configuration as shown below.  ```java Config config = new Config(); NetworkConfig network = config.getNetworkConfig();  JoinConfig join = network.getJoin(); join.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false); join.getTcpIpConfig().addMember(\&quot;IP1\&quot;)     .addMember(\&quot;IP2\&quot;).setEnabled(true); network.getInterfaces().setEnabled(true)     .addInterface(\&quot;IP1\&quot;).addInterface(\&quot;IP2\&quot;); ```     When you create the Hazelcast instance, you have to pass the configuration to the instance. If you create the instances without passing the configuration, each instance starts but cannot see each other. Therefore, a correct way to create the instance is the following:  ``` HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); ```  The following is an incorrect way:  ``` HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ```    "

    body: "# Glossary  Term|Definition :-|:- **2-phase Commit**|2-phase commit protocol is an atomic commitment protocol for distributed systems. It consists of two phases: commit-request and commit. In commit-request phase, transaction manager coordinates all of the transaction resources to commit or abort. In commit-phase, transaction manager decides to finalize operation by committing or aborting according to the votes of the each transaction resource. **ACID**|A set of properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guaranteeing that transactions are processed reliably. Atomicity requires that each transaction be all or nothing (i.e. if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction will fail). Consistency ensures that only valid data following all rules and constraints is written. Isolation ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference (and without transaction ordering). Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, no matter if there is a power loss, crash, or error. **Cache**|A high-speed access area that can be either a reserved section of main memory or storage device.  **Client Server Topology**|Hazelcast topology where members run outside the user application, and are connected to clients using client libraries. The client library is installed in the user application. **Embedded Topology**|Hazelcast topology where the members are in-process with the user application and act as both client and server. **Garbage Collection**|Garbage collection is the recovery of storage that is being used by an application when that application no longer needs the storage. This frees the storage for use by other applications (or processes within an application). It also ensures that an application using increasing amounts of storage does not reach its quota. Programming languages that use garbage collection are often interpreted within virtual machines like the JVM. The environment that runs the code is also responsible for garbage collection. **Hazelcast Cluster**|A virtual environment formed by Hazelcast members communicating with each other in the cluster. **Hazelcast Partitions**|Memory segments containing the data. Hazelcast is built-on the partition concept, it uses partitions to store and process data. Each partition can have hundreds or thousands of data entries depending on your memory capacity. You can think of a partition as a block of data. In general and optimally, a partition should have a maximum size of 50-100 Megabytes. **IMDG**|An in-memory data grid (IMDG) is a data structure that resides entirely in memory, and is distributed among many members in a single location or across multiple locations. IMDGs can support thousands of in-memory data updates per second, and they can be clustered and scaled in ways that support large quantities of data. **Invalidation**|The process of marking an object as being invalid across the distributed cache. **Java heap**|Java heap is the space that Java can reserve and use in memory for dynamic memory allocation. All runtime objects created by a Java application are stored in heap. By default, the heap size is 128 MB, but this limit is reached easily for business applications. Once the heap is full, new objects cannot be created and the Java application shows errors. **LRU, LFU**|LRU and LFU are two of eviction algorithms. LRU is the abbreviation for Least Recently Used. It refers to entries eligible for eviction due to lack of interest by applications. LFU is the abbreviation for Least Frequently Used. It refers to the entries eligible for eviction due to having the lowest usage frequency. **Member**|A Hazelcast instance. Depending on your Hazelcast usage, it can refer to a server or a Java virtual machine (JVM). Members belong to a Hazelcast cluster. Members are also referred as member nodes, cluster members, or Hazelcast members. **Multicast**|A type of communication where data is addressed to a group of destination members simultaneously. **Near Cache**|A caching model. When Near Cache is enabled, an object retrieved from a remote member is put into the local cache and the future requests made to this object will be handled by this local member. For example, if you have a map with data that is mostly read, then using Near Cache is a good idea. **NoSQL**|\&quot;Not Only SQL\&quot;. A database model that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is tailored in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. It is a type of database which does not adhering to the traditional relational database management system (RDMS) structure. It is not built on tables and does not employ SQL to manipulate data. It also may not provide full ACID guarantees, but still has a distributed and fault tolerant architecture. **OSGI**|Formerly known as the Open Services Gateway initiative, it describes a modular system and a service platform for the Java programming language that implements a complete and dynamic component model. **Partition Table**|Table containing all members in the cluster, mappings of partitions to members, and further metadata. **Race Condition**|This condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. **RSA**|An algorithm developed by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman to generate, encrypt and decrypt keys for secure data transmissions.  **Serialization**|Process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization. **Split Brain**|Split brain syndrome, in a clustering context, is a state in which a cluster of members gets divided (or partitioned) into smaller clusters of members, each of which believes it is the only active cluster. **Transaction**|Means a sequence of information exchange and related work (such as data store updating) that is treated as a unit for the purposes of satisfying a request and for ensuring data store integrity.
